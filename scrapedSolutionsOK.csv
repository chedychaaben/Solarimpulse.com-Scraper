Our smart unit operates autonomously using a fixed setpoint to ensure regulatory compliance. By combining different data, whether atmospheric, process-related or collected from local residents via the odor observatory, MyClaugerDetect determines a risk level in terms of air quality. If the odor risk is high, MyClaugerDetect automatically adjusts the setpoint. The exhaust air is then filtered in the activated carbons. The goal is to use it as little as possible to limit the environmental impact. If the risk is low, MyClaugerDetect automatically pilots an air bypass to optimize the use of activated carbons. MyClaugerDetect makes it possible to meet regulatory constraints with smarter, waste-free consumption. Resulting in cleaner industrial sites, so that everyone can live together peacefully.","November 15, 2022",Clauger,France,Medium and large scale commercialization,"New clients, Visibility, Credibility","BusinessMining & Extraction, BusinessManufacturingChemicals & Pharmaceuticals, BusinessManufacturingMachinery & Turbines, BusinessManufacturingMetals & Steel, BusinessManufacturingMinerals & Concrete

This poses a major problem for us and our environment. Plastic bottles are not only responsible for a large portion of the world's plastic waste problem, it also takes 1 to 2 liters of clean water and other precious resources to make a 1-liter plastic bottle.

That's why we developed the DrinkPure water filter. DrinkPure is a simple source for natural and healthy water straight from every tap. Our filter can effectively remove microplastics, pathogens, pesticides, odors and other contaminants. This has been proven by accredited testing laboratories. The filter can be easily screwed to all standard faucets. Our customers benefit from filtered drinking water without compromise! Thanks to the QuickFix filter coupling,  you decide whether water is filtered or not. One filter lasts for about two months. DrinkPure doesn’t only help you reduce plastic waste.

The unit consists of three main subsystems; Panel, Power Take-Off and Foundation. As Panel moves in sea, it absorbs energy from waves. Panel is connected to mechanical drivetrain which results in hydraulic fluids being pumped inside a closed hydraulic circuit. All the elements of the hydraulic circuit are enclosed inside a hermetic structure inside the device and are not exposed to the marine environment.

By allowing the NovaAir to run on the natural refrigerant propane instead of widespread synthetic refrigerants, its emissions are up to 700 times lower than those of refrigerants in conventional heat pumps. When compared to a Single Family Home running on gas or oil heating, 3500-4500 kg CO2-equivalents can be saved annually. Meanwhile, annual operating costs are halved, which drastically lowers costs during the estimated 30 year lifetime.



The gain in energy efficiency stems from an intricate design made in Switzerland in combination with a digital platform, that allows for continuous optimization and seamless integration with solar panels and features of the “Smart Home”.

In most cases, these impacts are a few centimeters in diameter. The structure is initially not impacted but can degrade over time if the paint is not repaired (for example, because of corrosion).



Local repair of a paint system is a lengthy process, requiring surface preparation, followed by the application of multiple paint layers: anticorrosion, primer and a topcoat.

The root cause of this problem is loose waste that occupies much more space than its actual volume. Garbage, in an uncompacted state, tend to overflow dustbins- and create an unhygienic atmosphere. They require frequent clearing, which ultimately increases the workload of health and sanitation workers. Garbage typically are then transported to open landfills further causing air, water and land pollution, adding to the health and environmental concerns. In most countries, only a fraction of the total garbage is sent for waste processing. The logistics cost is spent in garbage collection from door to door, waste processing centres, and landfill sites. Such collection trips are expensive due to the high number of trips required, fuel and labour cost involved, etc. The solution, RecycloBin is a smart waste compactor bin that aims at bringing efficiency in the current waste management systems by reducing waste volume at the source. RecycloBin can reduce space occupied by loose waste by at least 6 to 10 times as compared to regular dustbins.

Yangi can produce 3D-formed packaging directly from cellulose pulp in one machine line at a 30% lower cost than existing fibre-based solutions, with minimal water and less energy use, resulting in a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions. Also, compared to other cellulose materials, dry formed packaging is unique in terms of shapeability, aesthetics, and appearance. Depending on packaging requirements, barrier chemistry can be added in the process or added in a separate sequence afterward.

Furthermore, its much-reduced weight brings benefits for fuel economy when installed on mobile machines. Should a leak occur, the VVR will have minimal impact on the environment, resulting in lower decontamination costs and prohibitive fines. Being airless and sealed, the VVR works in any environment (from under-sea to high altitude) and in any orientation. Its versatility makes a perfect fit for numerous applications exposed to difficult conditions where CHRs is no match. Lastly, its small volume makes it more appealing to fill with bio-fluids, which can be very expensive when used in CHRs.","June 16, 2021",Smart Reservoir,Canada,Medium and large scale commercialization,"Network, New clients, Visibility, Credibility, Partners",BusinessManufacturingMachinery & Turbines,"Lightweight, Fuel efficiency, Hydropower","Energy, Energy storage",https://youtu.be/HFp4vbO0xuI,"Up to 50 times smaller than traditional reservoirs with the same performance, leading to large reduction in oil use;Sealed and airless, preventing contamination and moisture entering the fluid, consequently prolonging fluid life by 3 to 5 times;Up to 100 times lighter than traditional reservoirs, resulting in fuel savings on mobile machines and less pollution;",Reduced fluid use with the same performance delivers significant cost savings;Payback in less than three years;,"Europe,Asia,North america,South america,Australia","Italy,France,Germany,United Arab Emirates,South Korea,Oman,Turkey,Canada,Mexico,United States,Argentina,Australia,New Zealand","Storage GEM®: Smart energy management system in containerized storage units for rapid deployment (Energy);Smart Energy Hub: An innovative hydrogen-based energy storage solution for buildings (Buildings & Shelters,Energy);Cool Green Energy Factory: An innovative energy concept to make cooling processes economically and ecologically sustainable (Energy,Industry & Consumer Goods);Solar GEM® (Green Energy in Motion): Smart energy management system for solar power plants (Energy);",/companies/view/smart-reservoir

This conserves scarce landfill space (around 1200 truck loads in 2020), conserves primary raw materials, and saves 10% CO2 compared to a CO2-optimised Swiss mass concrete (30% vs a type I concrete). The CO2 savings in 2020 were equivalent to 4700 people flying from Zurich to New York. Susteno is also a solution for companies that recycle concrete and mixed demolition waste and are looking for a sustainable alternative to landfilling the unusable fine fractions. Susteno is the next generation of mass concrets with a more ecological footprint and complies with all norms.

This typically comes at a high energy cost, which is in turn typically produced from non-renewable sources. In certain industries and buildings, such as hotels for tourism or hospitals for healthcare, air-conditioning is frequently the largest single usage of energy, representing up to 40% of total consumption. This solution aims to drastically reduce the amount of energy consumed to produce air conditioning while using a renewable natural source of cold. The solution could be implemented anywhere with suitable bathymetry and easy access to deep ocean water and strong AC needs. The concept of the solution is to give the opportunity to have cool air when needed, while considerably decreasing the energy consumption and our carbon footprint. The solution is a Sea Water Air Conditioning (SWAC) system. This system permits to save about 42% of energy comparing to a conventional AC system.

The TPS process is an efficient, fast and sturdy technology based on existing industrial supercritical processes. The solvents used, coupled with supercritical CO2, allows to delaminate the different layers of the wastes' materials (glues and bonds at the interface of materials are dissolved). The TPS process is a clean chemical process using mainly supercritical CO2 for the separation of multi-layer complex wastes and products, to enable their recycling. Non-recyclable wastes can then become fully recyclable. TPS Process gives a new life to multi-layer complex wastes.

Air pollution from motorized mobility in cities harms the health of the inhabitants and jobs in the automotive industry are shifting to Asia. These are some of the reasons which led to the development of the Clean Vehicle Directive (DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/1161). According to this directive, municipalities are forced to reach procurement targets of clean and energy-efficient vehicles. This is a huge challenge for municipalities, as existing alternatives to diesel buses are not always suitable or are extremely expensive. In order to meet the needs of these municipalities, CMF recovers their old buses and remove all diesel components like tanks, engine etc. and install the patented CMF drive. It consists of an electric drivetrain with an onboard charger and enables 3-fold energy savings: Through the recovery of braking energy, usage of engine waste heat and constant optimal load at the on-board charger. Thanks to upcycling, CMF avoids the production of unnecessary material. The CMF drive runs on liquid natural gas (LNG), Bio-LNG or synthetic natural gas.

This is because of potential frost damage, and/or condensation/rain penetration could cross the cavity and make the living space damp if an attempt is made to go higher. The Carbon Cut system overcomes these problems by using its unique design to collect the water and divert it out through the boundary wall thus reducing “bridging” (water transference across the cavity) and the associated damp risk on the internal walls of the cavity, and by reducing frost damage to the outer walls. In addition, the system does not create further cold spots. The system provides a barrier that can close any part of a cavity completely, independent of height.

As a result, surplus electricity is generated in windy and sunny periods, which to an increasing share cannot be fed into the grid. On the other hand, the deconstruction of conventional power plants causes supply gaps in times of low wind and sun. Therefore the development and installation of innovative long term storage technologies is one of the main challenges in the transformation of the energy system. In order to tackle this challenge, MicrobEnergy has developed its own system of power-to-gas technology. With this process, electricity can be converted into hydrogen by electrolysis. This hydrogen can either be used directly or, in a second step, converted together with carbon dioxide from a biogas or sewage plant into methane gas. Chemically identical to natural gas, methane can be fed into the natural gas grid in unlimited quantities. In this way the existing infrastructure of the natural gas network can be used as a huge energy storage and transport system. BiON contributes to a greener world by converting the energy from wind and sun into renewable gas, thus creating a climate-friendly energy source that can be used universally.

Azelio can balance the output and match demand through storing energy from day to night or from one day to the other, thereby also increasing the productivity from renewable solutions and the use of clean power in the grid. Azelio is using recycled aluminum as a storage medium. It does not require any refilling for maintained capacity as opposed to thermal storage using salt or water. It can be used over and over without any degraded capacity, and it does not use any scarce minerals.

Water quality in fish farming systems rapidly deteriorates as fishes consume O2 and discharge CO2 as part of their respiration. Uneaten food and feces accumulate creating an unhealthy environment. This is further compounded by the spread of undesirable microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and viruses in the rearing system. To tackles these challenges, Searen developed  Vacuum AirLift™ or VAL™,  a simple multi-functional device that performs essential functions reliably and efficiently.  The VAL™ is an enabling technology that makes recirculating aquaculture systems profitable and environmentally sustainable. Recirculating aquaculture systems produce high-quality protein and nutritious food in a controlled environment. High quality product requires precision control of the water condition. The VAL™ is a smart technology that provides water circulation, carbon dioxide and other undesirable gas stripping, oxygenation and particulate removal in a single simple device. The VAL™ uses a vacuum pump to power a microbubble airlift pump. The airlift pump provides low head water circulation. The microbubbles provide gas exchange allowing undesirable gases to be extracted by the vacuum. The microbubbles also attract fine particulates creating foam that is removed by the vacuum.

This process allows a sound and positive management of inert construction soil, which accounts into close to 60% of total waste in France. Given the fact that land-use developments created through this Solution are located close to city centres, it avoids trucks transporting soil to go to their traditional dumping places located far from the city.  Through this Solution, cities find a way to finance land-use developments and thus increase green areas.

It has also raised concerns about the warming of the greenhouse effect and the alteration of the global nitrogen cycle, and thus of primary production and vegetation diversity. The use of chemical fertilisers is always a necessity, however, for the chemical form that these fertilisers have, they are also biocidal agents, killing certain elements in the soil, such as micro-organisms, which could transform them into elements immediately absorbable by crops. The destruction of these beneficial micro-organisms also creates the conditions for pathogens to develop in the soil, thus increasing the need for polluting plant protection products. All this has a direct impact on productivity and quality, as the entire crop food chain can be affected. Bioma has developed new, completely natural solutions, to be used once a year at the beginning of the agricultural season, which allow the soil microbiology to develop rapidly, within a few weeks, and immediately transform and provide nutritional elements to the crops. The solutions have been shown in several studies to reduce chemical fertilizers by at least 50% while increasing the quality and quantity of production.

To tackle this challenge, the Pinovo system delivers a solution that removes paint and rust from corroded steel surfaces, without microplastics emissions. Inside the tools, grit hits the surface to be treated at high speed. The old paint and rust are then sucked back into the system by vacuum, and are kept in a closed loop and not released into the environment. The grit is recycled and reused 10 to 20 times. After treatment, the surface has a superior finish, and is ready for the new coating.

This is very damaging to the environment, contributing a huge 3.1 million tons of CO2 equivalents a year. SageTech’s solution prevents this atmospheric discharge, collects the exhaled drug, and re-purifies it, fit for human re-use. Drug metabolism is low, around 5%, so recovery yields are very high. The solution deploys a system of collection and purification that has sustainability at its core. Working with our pressure systems keeps instruments compact and no organic solvents are used in our process. SageTech’s solution offers large financial savings on hospital infrastructure installations and maintenance costs by eliminating the need for expensive air extraction systems to take the exhaled drugs from the operating theatres to the chimney.","October 19, 2020",SageTech Medical Equipment,United Kingdom,Prototype testing in the real world,"Network, New clients, Visibility, Funding, Partners, Credibility","BusinessServicesHealthcare & Medical Institution

The absence of proper water disinfection triggers health and environmental issues that translate into worldwide economic problems. People in rural areas of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are the most affected and have poor access to safe drinking water. The currently available methods in a household to disinfect water are expensive and have associated health and environmental problems such as toxicity, CO2 emissions, and deforestation. WADI allows households to obtain safe drinking water through a solar disinfection process. It is an external device that indicates the progress of the disinfection process of the water.

There’s a clear need for more efficient motors to save energy, cut power bills and reduce CO2 emissions. The IE5 ultra-premium SynRM motors offer up to 50% lower energy losses, lower energy consumption than the commonly used IE2 induction motors. Case studies in industrial installations have demonstrated energy savings of up to 25%, depending on the application. The IE5 level of efficiency is made possible by the SynRM design which combines the performance advantages of permanent magnet technology with the simplicity and service-friendliness of an induction platform. To ensure an environmentally friendly design, the permanent magnets do not feature rare earth materials. Additional benefits of the IE5 SynRM motor are lower bearing and winding temperatures for enhanced reliability and long life. The design also creates less motor noise for a better working environment. IE5 SynRM motors can be used in a wide range of demanding industrial applications where they offer accurate control and high efficiency across the whole speed range, even at partial loads. This makes them an ideal upgrade option for standard induction motors in pumps, fans and compressors as well as in more demanding applications like extruders, concha mixers, winches, and conveyors. IE5 SynRM motors are an easy replacement for induction motors as they have the same size and output power, so no mechanical modifications are required.

Those same trucks generate a considerable amount of pollution that must be reduced: in London, for instance, road freight is responsible for 13% of CO2, 24% of NOx, and 12% of PM2.5 emissions. How can this circle be squared? Some use cases, like short, clearly defined, and unchanging back-to-base routes, such as postal delivery, lend themselves to electrification but this is not the case for the majority of 12t to 44t vehicles and OEM offerings reflect this. Even when available, fully-electric solutions require operators to spend more, haul less, and to depend on charging infrastructure which is sometimes proprietary, in a business sector where margins are razor-thin. The stop/start nature of driving urban or congested routes leads to excessive fuel consumption and emissions. By capturing energy during braking, storing it, and then using this recovered energy to help power the next acceleration, Adgero's KERS can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions on these cycles by over 20% while also reducing NOx and PM. The KERS telematics suite will stream data to the telematics solution of the operator's choice and its ECU is designed to receive over the air updates to ensure peak performance. Adgero's Kinetic Energy Recovery System is affordable, retrofittable, reusable, and compatible with virtually any HGV on the road, whether rigid or tractor-trailer combinations.

There is an opportunity in growing food on barren land. Arborea believes that “photosynthetic microorganisms” will be a key choice for the production of food ingredients. Photosynthetic microorganisms are the fastest-growing primary producers of food in nature, and they produce the same ingredients as plant crops, without environmental constraints and pollution. They yield up to 40x time more proteins than plant crops in a single acre of land. Furthermore, they don’t need agricultural feedstock like cane sugar, they don’t need soil, don’t produce nitrogen runoffs, consume little water, don’t promote deforestation or loss of biodiversity.  The “BioSolar Leaf” is a membrane-driven breathing-bioreactor® technology that enables a hyper-efficient gas transfer and temperature control while maintaining optimal growth conditions.

Today, heating and cooling small businesses and residential settings represent 25% of the EU’s energy consumption. Condensing boilers and heat pumps are the main options nowadays. If heat pumps have a much better energy efficiency than condensing boilers, they are also more expensive during the initial installation and their exploitation. Indeed, heat pumps are powered with electricity coming from the grid and their efficiency is jeopardized by the higher cost of the electricity in comparison to natural gas. In addition, during wintertime, the efficiency of the heat pump significantly decreases which contributes to a significant increase of electricity consumption. Moreover, the inefficiencies of centralized production (40%) and the losses in transportation (5-10%) contribute to lower the global footprint of heat pumps. FLAMINCO merges 3 technologies in one pathway towards energy decarbonization: gas micro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power), heat pumps, and condensing boilers.

Specifically, brake wear dust is estimated to contribute 16-55% of non-exhaust traffic-related emissions. The impact of this pollution is catastrophic as it can cause cardio-respiratory problems or lung cancer to those who are exposed.

The Seawind systems are assembled at a pier or at a dry dock and brought to the installation site completely assembled. In the case of floating systems, installation means simply anchoring. In the case of bottom fixed systems, installation means lowering the complete system to the seabed and actuate suction buckets. The time of installation is drastically reduced, complete systems can be stored in sheltered waters for installation during calm weather windows. The overall time for the realization of a complete offshore wind farm (500+ MW) goes down to less than one year. Foundations are made of UHPC, the lifetime of the wind farm is 50+ years, hence the system can run for many years at marginal costs, like large hydropower plants.

By curing very rapidly, the composites can be used to make components measured in tens - or even hundreds - of thousands of parts per year. This is contrast to traditional composite technologies that are more suited to mere hundreds of parts per year. Through the industrialisation of these composite technologies, car manufacturers can significantly reduce the weight of their vehicles - with a positive effect on emissions of CO2 and particulates.

Currently, it is forecasted an increasing demand of REE, mainly for neodymium-based permanent magnets used in highly effective motors for hybrid vehicles and wind turbine generators. The REE supply is however at risk due to the unpredictable trading policies. The REE4EU technology seeks to cover the European demand for REE using secondary REE-containing resources (i.e. from waste) currently available in Europe, thus realising an innovative closed-loop REE recycling process where REE-containing wastes are converted into REE-final products. The REE final products manufactured with recycled material showed the same properties as those made from virgin materials. Not only does REE4EU reduce landfill, but it also has far lower CO2 emissions than extracting and using virgin materials. Moreover, it also highlights competitive costs compared to the conventional scenario of primary REE extraction. The REE4EU technology can secure important value chains in Europe necessary for decarbonisation, resource efficiency and zero waste targets and gives a promising market opportunity for a European REE recycling business.","July 22, 2020",SINTEF,Norway,Prototype testing in the real world,"Credibility, visibility, investment","BusinessManufacturingBatteries & Battery Parts, BusinessManufacturingComputers & Other Electronics, BusinessManufacturingMachinery & Turbines, BusinessManufacturingMetals & Steel","Electronic waste, Rare earths, Waste-to-materials, Recycle waste, Industrial Waste, Industrial materials","Industry/Goods, Waste/Pollution, Materials and chemicals, Manufacturing and construction processes, Solid waste management",https://youtu.be/6b0CS65a1Ro,Around 50% lower GHG emissions compared to use of virgin REE materials;Around 35% lower primary energy consumption than mainstream alternative;,Payback period of under three years;,Europe,Norway,"WOODOO: A bio-based translucent wood material for sustainable construction applications (Industry & Consumer Goods);SEAB Energy - Flexibuster: A small-scale modular container for transforming organic waste into energy (Energy,Waste & Pollution,Food & Agriculture);Pellenc ST: Optical sorting machines to recycle large amounts of waste quickly and accurately (Waste & Pollution);LACTIPS: A 100% biobased material for a sustainable packaging alternative (Industry & Consumer Goods);",/companies/view/sintef

These hybrid systems allow revenue stacking on new energy markets whilst reducing emissions and costs and increasing energy security. A challenge however remains in the complexity of the assessment of such systems. Due to their lack of awareness and skills, commercial and industrial energy consumers struggle to find appropriate partners or stuck in an intricate procedure with too many different actors (engineering consultancy, contractors, operators, etc.). This results in losing time and transparency and leads to a less profitable solution as each actor tends to sell their off-the-shelf solution or expertise. Optiwize® is a data-driven AI web solution providing decision makers in commercial and industrial sites autonomous guidance to analyse, implement and control optimal onsite renewable energy generation and storage installations. Assembling global measurement data of site energy consumption, meteorological conditions, GHG emissions, energy prices and other financial information, Optiwize® detects the most suitable investments in new and clean energy technologies and maintains maximum profitability of the achieved installation on real time by calculating optimal setpoints in line with the organisation's ecological and economical targets.
