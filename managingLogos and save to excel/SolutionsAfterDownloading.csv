L’apparition de nouveaux composants chimiques, perturbateur endocrinien, métaux lourds, impactent lourdement notre environnement et bouleversent notre biodiversité. 



Les effluents (industrielles ou domestiques) sont dirigés dans les mêmes réseaux de collectes et traitement des eaux usées. Cependant, force est de constater que l’efficacité et le rendement de ces STEP ont une charge physico-chimique, et biologique non traitée dans les eaux de rejets. (1)



Les marchés cibles visés par cette démarche :

-	L’industrie, l’agriculture, les syndicats des eaux, les collectivités (EPCI…), l’immobilier dans l’objectif est de proposer des services commerciaux tels que : 

-  Traitement tertiaire des eaux en sortie de STEP, pour une amélioration de la qualité des eaux,

-  Potabilisation des eaux de captage et de production des eaux,

- La collecte et l’analyse de données issues de la Blue DATA pour dimensionnement et 

   modélisation de la gestion des flux,

- Services de données dédiées pour les collectivités, institutions, laboratoires, industries....



Pour répondre à ces nombreux objectifs environnementaux et sociétaux, le projet CLEAR IMPACT STATION est né. Notre volonté est également de contribuer au maintien de la biodiversité, et de réduire la présence, en constante augmentation, des polluants dans les eaux. 

C’est ainsi qu’à la lumière de ces constats est née l’idée de la construction d’un prototype expérimental, une station d’épuration ou de potabilisation, mobile et connectée à microfiltration de zéolites naturelles activées.



Ces roches d’origine volcanique présentent des propriétés intéressantes dans les applications du traitement des eaux (usées, potabilisation, traitement d’eaux industrielles…) notamment dans leur capacité d’adsorption et désorption (voir lexique annexe A). 



Les zéolites sont utilisées dans l'industrie comme échangeurs de cations, adsorbants sélectifs et catalyseurs, ce qui font d’elles des candidates idéales pour le développement d’applications dans le domaine du traitement des eaux usées (2).



L’objectif visé par ce prototype expérimental est de développer une modélisation des procédés de microfiltrations à zéolites naturelles, de pouvoir produire de l’eau potable dans n’importe quelle situation, de traiter les effluents industriels lors d’incidents environnementaux. 

Le second est de pouvoir modéliser et pré-dimensionner le traitement de gros volumes d’effluents industriels en sortie de station de traitement (STEP), ou d’utilisation de ce procédé en production d’eau potable avec des zéolites naturelles activées. 



La réalisation de cette CIS permettra de mesurer l’impact environnemental de la future solution proposée à l’industriel ou aux collectivités en charge de la gestion du réseau d’adduction en eau potable.

Son fonctionnement est facilité par l’informatique embraquée, à la remontée d’alertes ou arrêts intempestifs, du monitoring du procédé de filtration des eaux, le débit et le volume etc…

Concernant le fonctionnement et la gestion des eaux à traiter par la CIS, le premier critère que nous avons choisi est la modularité. Ce qui signifie qu’il est interopérable avec les systèmes actuels ou futur.  Evolutif, dans son mode de fonctionnement (ajout d’un conteneur supplémentaire accueillant un complément de systèmes de filtrations). L’aide et la consolidation de données en pré-diagnostique des flux d’eaux à traiter. Enfin comme la CIS est nomade, cela permet son implantation dans n’importe quel environnement.



Les flux d’entrées saturés (chargés) seront dirigés vers le skid 1 (décanteur, coagulateur) chargé de capter les premiers éléments tels que les matières en suspensions par exemple.

Puis ces flux de sorties entrent dans le second skid dans le 1er bac tampon pour être envoyés dans deux filtres à zéolites naturelles, et dirigés vers un bac de sortie de traitement des eaux usées. Tout au long de ce processus, des capteurs (clarinettes) seront chargés de collecter les données (débit, température, pH, KH, TAC, conductivité etc…)

Ces données d’entrées/sorties alimenteront la Blue Data. 



L’ensemble du procédé est contrôlé en direct ‘’sous monitoring processus’’. L’analyse de la qualité et du rendement de la microfiltration à zéolites, permettra grâce à la CLEAR IMPACT STATION de dimensionner (modélisation) et calibrer la phase I (pré déploiement industriel) et la phase II du projet son déploiement à taille ‘’cousue-main’’ industriel (modulable et adaptable à divers cas de figures). 



Pour conclure, l’innovation est un impératif de pérennité et rentabilité pour les entreprises, les collectivités. La transformation écologique reste, à tort, l’expression d’un coût financier, sans mesurer l’impact environnemental et sociétal. 

La maîtrise de rejet est un enjeu majeur, de l’accompagnement de leur transformation pour rendre plus lisible et donner une image positive (attrait de l’entreprise, amélioration des normes au regard des institutions, organismes gestionnaires des réseaux d’AEP, les organismes de gestion de l’environnement…).

La transformation RSE, également présente de cette démarche, valorisera l’image de marque de l’entreprise : vertueuse, respectueuse de l’environnement. 

Il n’y aura pas de transformation écologique sans l’engagement des industriels, ou des collectivités. CLEAR IMPACT STATION est le moyen d’engager cette transformation selon le principe d’un prototype expérimental mais aussi enrichi et reproductible.

Underwater noises have been the subject of numerous scientific publications over the last 25 years and are recognised as one of the worst maritime pollution. Human activities produce huge noise in the environment. These noises propagate almost without attenuation. That’s why marine animals perceive  accumulated noises up to several thousand kilometers around them. Pile driving during maritime works, creates one of the most intense noises, up to 260dB! This level is responsible for major impacts up to the death of individuals. Thus, protecting the ecosystem from these noises is vital for all species and finally for mankind.

However, today's refrigeration (HVAC-R) systems are using intensively fluorinated gases as refrigerant. These gases contribute greatly to the greenhouse effect. 1kg of fluorinated gases leaking to the atmosphere is equivalent to 3,5 tons of CO2 in average. In a global scale, the contribution of fluorinated gases to global warming represents 1 billion tons of CO2 per year.



The awareness of the impact of the F-gases on the global warming pushed most governments to regulate the use of these refrigerants with a shot-term phase-out plan by leading regions such as Europe and United States. Similar regulations exists all around the world following to the Kigali Agreement.



Alternative refrigerants exist on the market. However, they can be toxic, inflammable or work under very high pressure, leading to very high constraints on the installation and the maintenance.



Our idea is a simple one: instead of using hazardous fluid which are produced in a questionable way and which have harmful impact on the environment, we thought of using the most natural, abundant and neutral fluid in the world, water!



Water is a formidable fluid with excellent thermodynamics properties. It can be used in a refrigeration system for all positive temperature application. Its use in a refrigeration system is very efficient and scalable with a gain of 30% in energy efficiency compared to conventional refrigeration system and a cooling power range from 2kW to 2MW.

However, solar and wind power only produce when the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining. This causes grid instability due to loss of system “inertia”, which ultimately impacts energy supply to consumers. Electricity is difficult to store on a large scale; production must always be at least equal to consumption. Without a mass storage solution, renewable energies have no future. OXTO ON is a flywheel and this Solution will lead the stability of inertia of the system, fostering renewable integration and electrification of transport. A flywheel is considered a mechanical battery that stores kinetic energy in the form of a rotating mass. It is a truly sustainable solution to the challenges of decarbonising power generation and transport industries.

OXTO has developed a new clean mechanical battery, made of steel totally recyclable, climate agnostic and with unlimited cycles, to deliver safe, scalable and lowest cost power storage solutions.

OXTO’s technology uses the principles inherited from previous successful deployments in satellite: simple design with fewest possible components, robust device with very limited maintenance over a long lifetime of 25-30 years.

The design allows for working alongside any power application from wind turbines and heavy-industry to EV-charging infrastructure.



Our solution addresses the following challenges:

•	EV charging infrastructure: the electrical grids as they were conceived cannot cope with a future dense EV infrastructure. The problem is the power required to simultaneously charge several vehicles or to fast charge vehicles. Our solution is a power buffer to any grid connection.

•	Smart Grid and Distribution: our solution addresses issues of inertia, voltage support (e.g. over-voltage raised by solar power plants). We combine our solution with other technologies to make an overall smart grid (solar, wind, flow batteries, compressed air, EV charging…)

•	Storage and flexibility: our solution provides flexibility by making renewable power plant the next generation of autonomous power plants. By combining a means of renewable energy and storage technologies to our flywheel solution, we can create a stand-alone power plant that meets the challenges of the energy transition in the world.



Flywheels will hence foster integration of REN and help cope with the EV charging infrastructure, whatever the grid connection. It will clearly reduce air and noise pollution.

Impacts: reduce the energy bill of communities (expensive fossil fuel); Reduce GHG emissions; reduce noise pollution (motorbikes, rickshaw, bus… with petrol engines); reduce water contamination (risk of fuel leakage from gas motorbikes maintenance) by fostering the electrification of transports.",http://oxtoenergy.com,"SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities",2.0

The deployment of Energo's technology contributes to the construction of a circular economy applied to the management/upgrading of CO2 emissions by converting these harmful species into value-added products (methane, green chemistry, hydrogen...) and thus helping the transition to a sustainable future. Over the next 6 years, ENERGO plans to neutralize CO2 emissions from industrial sites by avoiding more than 350 kTCO2 and converting them into more than 50kT of green chemical molecules.

Its patented technology emerged from PSL research laboratories, involves the combination of a non-thermal DBD cold plasma, and a heterogeneous catalyst, providing plasma-catalysis conversion of molecular products in gaseous form into gaseous or liquid molecular products with high added value.

ENERGO's technology has achieved a TRL 7 for CO2 methanation with a semi-industrial demonstrator in operation since August 2021, which is a world first. It is worth noting that ENERGO was the first company in France to inject syngas into the grid in July 2022. After the successful scale-up of ENERGO’s technology, it is clear nowadays that plasma catalysis is an emerging way to do green chemistry.

This innovative technology has a wide range of applications and can produce several molecules of interest (hydrogen, methanol, ammonia, liquid fuels, and fine chemicals (olefins, oxygenates, alcohols, ketones, acids...) offering several advantages over conventional technologies, whilst maintaining the same catalytic reactor structure. These molecules are mainly produced from CO2 stemming from local sources such as biogas and would not only result in a negative carbon footprint but also could solve the long-distance supply chain problem.

In addition, it not only increases the catalytic and energy performance of each application, but also meets the current challenges of decarbonization by reducing the environmental impact, costs (CAPEX and OPEX) and risks of industrial units, thanks to the following advantages

Operation at atmospheric pressure and moderate temperature.

Catalyst volume at least 50 times smaller than that used in conventional reactors.

Resistance to most pollutants, such as oxygen, moisture, or VOCs (volatile organic compounds), thus reducing the need for pre-treatment.

Rapid cold start in seconds.

Production of high-value molecules in a single pass.

Very low reactor volume required (compact process + low catalyst cost)

Very high efficiency (an energy consumption of less than 1% compared to that produced).

 

Facing climate and geopolitical challenges, ENERGO aims to contribute its expertise and technological know-how to develop innovative solutions for the future that are simultaneously more affordable and more responsible. At the beginning of next year, ENERGO will build other demonstrators to prove the validity and relevance of its technology for the synthesis of all these new molecules of interest. The first one will be dedicated to the conversion of CO2 into methane (300kW capacity) and the second one, will be our own chemical plant that can produce 20t/month of green chemicals from a biogas plant.

From a market perspective, we are targeting 3 main markets where our technology can offer major advantages over conventional or green technologies in terms of carbon footprint (SCOPE 1/2/3) and molecule production cost. These latter are as follows:

 

- Methane production from waste: ENERGO's methanation process can be used to valorize plastic or wood waste by combining its technology with gasification, which produces syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, from which methane can then be produced.

- Green H2 production from ammonia synthesized by photovoltaic energy in sunny regions of the world such as the Sahara and then transported by ship to Europe. ENERGO's technology provides compact units that facilitate transportation and decentralization of consumption.

- Green chemistry production: local synthesis of chemical platform molecules from biogas plant required by the chemical industry at low cost.",http://energo.green,"SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

Governments have responded with more stringent regulations forcing more disclosure of product and supplier information. The combination of factors has created a “perfect storm” – resulting in the urgent need for a transformative approach to managing supply chain transparency. 

Our customers include marquis, global brands in the apparel, luxury cosmetics, food and consumer goods, including J. Crew, Chanel, Macy’s, Estee Lauder, Danone, P&G, Versace, Hill House Home, and L’Oréal.  These brands are connected with over 50,000 suppliers – from large factories to smallholder farms.

Globally, available freshwater resources are predicted to dwindle drastically due to the effects of climate change, while the demand for water is predicted to increase. Research shows that a behavioural change must be part of the solution that will reduce overall water demand. 

 

Aguardio’s mission is simple – to reduce water and energy consumption by supporting, improving and developing sustainable behaviour, and to reduce water waste by alerting to water leaks.



Our shower solution aims to motivate people to reduce their time in the shower by at least one minute: Each person will then save more than 10 litres of hot water and save enough energy to run a 60-watt light bulb for 6 hours. 



Our leak solution enables the detection of water leaks in toilets and from taps and is capable of preventing unnecessary water waste. 

 

Aguardio’s IoT sensors are designed to guide and motivate the user towards more sustainable habits. 



- Reduce shower time: Installed in the bathroom, Aguardio Shower Sensor causes a change in shower behaviour so as to reduce water and energy consumption. A combination of sensor technology and big data enables the Aguardio Shower Sensor to identify showers without having to access the water supply.

Aguardio Shower Sensor is much more than just a physical device - it’s a platform from where social norms can begin to change for the better. The sensor has a documented effect through a third party academic Research Study conducted by the University of Surrey.



- Detect leaking toilets and taps: The Aguardio Leak Sensor is a plug and play IoT sensor that can prevent substantial water waste in toilets. 

Many are not aware that at least 5-8% of all toilets leak clean water down the inner backside of the toilet pan. Leaks of even 274 litres daily can be invisible, as the water trickles down without disturbing the water surface in the toilet pan. The Aguardio Leak Sensor sounds a beep when it detects a leak, even as small as three litres of water an hour.

The company, based in Belfort in the Burgundy-Franco-Comté region, has forged partnerships in the fields of plastics processing and recycling with a view to eco-construction. It operates in a very favourable legislative and regulatory context. The management team, as well as the external contributors, are experienced in the various skills related to environmental protection, recycling and construction. The technological proposal is disruptive and will fully meet the expectations of designers, integrators and public decision makers. A sales force will be set up. The objective is to achieve a turnover of €13M by 2025, and thus to become a reference in this sector of activity with high technical, economic and environmental added value.



Soil artificialisation is now one of the main causes of climate change and the erosion of biodiversity. Rainfall episodes are more dense, which increases the risk of flooding. Every year, about 24,000 hectares are urbanised, the equivalent of the city of Marseille. Also, only 9% of plastic waste worldwide is recycled. The rest goes to landfill, incinerators, or worse, is exported out of sight. In France, 30% of plastics are now recycled, and the AGEC law aims to reach 100% by 2025.



Based on these observations, the SURFACE ALTERNATIVE VIOLETTE team has developed an eco-friendly, permeable road structure, of which the slab is a component.

It completely cures limestone and offers optimal drinking water quality with no discharge for operation, and thus takes care of equipment and the health of the house habitants.

The installation does not require a licensed plumber to install and commission the device.

The Bicarbonizer contributes to recycling CO2 by transforming limestone.

Unlike salt softeners, the solution does not consume salt and does not release brine water into the environment. Its CO2 consumption recycles the equivalent of the CO2 absorption of a small tree, i.e. a small tree per year per family.

The primary product of combustion is water (steam), which when condensed is clean enough to be sent to a drain or recycled to the boiler, to an electrolyzer, or to another process that can utilize (warm) water. The purity of this ""combustion"" or ""fuel"" steam makes it easier to condense vs. more a dilute steam such as that obtained by combusting hydrogen in air. The energy efficiency of the DCC™ boiler is therefore superior, which is especially relevant wherever the cost of hydrogen is high.

Why does accelerated materials discovery matter?



Accelerating R&D matters because materials are essential to improve our lives and tackle some of humanity’s biggest challenges. For example, better materials are key to reduce pollution and address climate change, and to improve health. We need better materials to get rid of microplastics and to develop a) more affordable batteries that last longer and are not toxic; b) more efficient solar cells that can be deployed everywhere; and c) more effective carbon capture, use and sequestration tech. Similarly, to discover new medicines and vaccines, we need to find the optimal conditions to hit the right molecules.



Fortunately, there are more molecules and materials waiting to be found than visible stars in a starry night, or grains of sand on Earth. Thus, the opportunity is immense!



Products:



Atinary offers proprietary ML algorithms that can be deployed seamlessly in existing workflows using Atinary’s no-code software platform, SDLabs. Users of SDLabs can accelerate R&D and discovery by 10x by augmenting lab scientists with machine learning technology that is simple to use, accessible in the cloud, and user friendly.



With SDLabs users can deploy ML algorithms to solve multi-objective optimization problems with multiple parameters, including categorical variables and non-linear constraints. Thus, SDLabs users can hit optimal chemical reactions to find the best materials and molecules in months or weeks, instead of years.

Voltiris' solution, consisting of color-optimized solar modules compatible with crop production, enables the energetic transition of greenhouses and allows greenhouse owners to gain in sustainability, energetic independence and viability. The solution, based on a spectral filtering technology, is compatible with high-light crops. Hence, growers can fully leverage the large surface of their greenhouses to cover them at max 35% with Voltiris modules. For a standard 5ha greenhouse, this results in up to ~17,500 solar modules installed, hence transforming the greenhouse into a photovoltaic power plant.

The innovative Voltiris modules allow a double use of agricultural land by producing electricity without reducing the yield of crops placed underneath. Indeed, Voltiris modules filter the light field in order to transmit to the plants the light waves necessary for their growth, the rest being used to generate electricity. With the renewable energy produced, greenhouse owners require less external gas and electricity, and can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs.

That provides cheap, clean and locally produced solar production unlike any other solution on the market today.



First, we purify the sand with several proprietary technologies.  Then, with the purified quartz (up to 95%), we extract the silicon and purify it to solar-grade form (99.99999%).

The vision

Agora Software was founded in 2019 in France, with the vision that a fragmented IT environment is a major obstacle preventing IT from delivering the promised benefits. To solve this problem, a strong statement was made: natural language, as people use it, can be an effective convergence layer in most cases if some technical challenges can be solved.



To implement this vision, Agora has developped a solution and a specialized NLP (natural language processing) in order to build bridges across the two main divides that digital projects faces:

	- Data sources are highly fragmented: IoT, business applications, web services, industrial devices, etc… Being able to bring them together in a simple and universal manner will deliver a huge value to businesses, people and society as a whole;

	- We (users, employees, citizens, families,etc.) are not HTML or API oriented: we are very social and communicative organisms, using our own language (aka natural language) to exchange information; we must be able to use digital services the same way: throughout our own language.



The Agora solution

The Agora Software solution is delivered from a resilient cloud platform that connects a large set of applications, web services, IoT platforms, etc. in a secure and private workspace. Two main services are available for each workspace:

	1. Define and activate scenarios from a no-code interface; these customer-defined scenarios make it possible to combine real-time data streams, identify trigger situations, generate in real-time commands to computing devices, applications, and more, as well as to send messages to people.

	2. Communicate with users in natural language: multi-intents, two-way flows, rich notifications, etc. Omnichannel, exchanges are delivered in a multilingual manner, on all business collaboration applications (MS Teams, Slack, Google, etc.) and social networks (Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, etc.).



The impact

The Agora solution can be used in many concrete situations: energy, smart cities, agriculture, industry, e-tourism, home support for the elderly, etc.: wherever the combination of multiple information flows is a source of value, innovation and well-being.

For example, in the sector of energy reduction for buildings, the combination of occupancy calendars, weather forecasts, power grid situation and occupancy sensor can reduce the energy consumption of the building by 20 % to 30% without costly modifications and without impact on the comfort of the users of these buildings.",http://agora.software,"SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

Poolover CTS principle:

-     During the opening hours the CTS cover lies at the bottom of the pool. 

-	When it is time to close the pool, air is injected into the cover, making it buoyant and float to the surface of the water thereby covering the entire surface of the pool.

-	In the morning, to open the pool, you release the air trapped in the cover, which lets water into the cover causing it to sink to the bottom of the pool.

The benefits:

-	Sobriety: quick to install with minimum structural works, which is a major benefit for existing pools compared to other options. Long life span of 15 years with minimum maintenance as it operates with air to go up and water to go down.

-	Efficiency: operates under all weather conditions, Poolover CTS is insensitive to wind and operates with lane dividers in place. Those two unique characteristic for a pool cover ensure it will be operated every day 

-	Renewable: when it’s time for a change the infrastructure is kept and what is replaced by new elements will be recycled

-	Safety: when in place no one can get inside the pool tank. Should a person accidentally fall onto the cover, the cover will stay firmly in place to prevent drowning.

-	Easy operation: one person only with no heavy lifting nor handling required. Surface cleaning or leaves removing in autumn can be performed by walking on it

Over the years this technology has been installed by many well-known global companies with excellent results. Our products have been applied into more than 300,000 applications to date. The company is also marketing EnviroTower (based on ScaleBuster technology) which is a unique cooling tower water treatment system which eliminates scale and corrosion as well as biological contamination, saving energy, water and chemicals. *How does it work? ScaleBuster is a Physical Water Conditioning technology, based on Electro-Static principles. Once the ScaleBuster is installed into the system the calcium and magnesium are precipitated into suspension. These particles remain within the flow of the water. When these particles reach the hot parts of the system the tendency to adhere to the hot surfaces is dramatically reduced. Therefore the ScaleBuster protects the equipment from potential limestone damage. The ScaleBuster is conceived to make the particles formed non-adherent. After installation of the ScaleBuster, limestone is mainly present in the form of aragonite, which is a non-adherent crystalline structure contrary to the untreated calcite that can cause deterioration and damage in unprotected systems. EnviroTower - cooling tower water treatment that really saves you money (and the environment). The patented EnviroTower - the Cooling Tower Water Treatment solution is designed around the ScaleBuster conditioner which precipitates the hardness (typically, Ca++ and Mg++ ions) in the cooling water, causing those ions to build clusters which grow larger as the water is recirculating through the ScaleBuster conditioner of the EnviroTower system, until they are removed from the water by the filtration or separation process. Scale-free chiller doesn’t waste energy as to lack of heat transfer (caused by the scale build up in the chiller tubes). 

Just as a reference, 3mm (1/8”) of scale causes the usage of 25% extra energy, resulting in higher head pressure (more wear-and-tear, shorten the life expectancy of the chiller) and also might cause down-time when least expected – in the middle of the summer…

The EnviroTower system is monitoring the cooling system’s water conductivity and controls the blow-down (so the operator can cycle up, saving water, while keeping the system scale-free). 

It also doses biocide (Bromine – as solid tablets – is recommended) as required, shocking the open circuit of the cooling tower once daily, as well as optional other chemicals (as Tri-Toly-Azole, to protect the copper tubes of the chillers). All chemicals are dosed as required, usually once daily only. The blown-down water is considered clean water and may be used for irrigation or be disposed in the storm system (vs. sewage).

In a period of 30 minutes after dosing any chemical – the EnviroTower system avoids any blow down (to eliminate drainage of the chemicals before they have actually performed in the water). 

The separator removes the precipitated hardness with some water (calculated as part of the blown down water). The EnviroTower controller is equipped with a light tower (green/amber/red) so the operator can simply and easily learn the status of the system. For more water conditioning, every make-up pipe is also equipped with a smaller ScaleBuster conditioner treating the water coming into the cooling tower.

Typical ROI is less than 3 years, OpEx (Operation Expenditure) with EnviroTower is usually 10-15% less vs. traditional water treatment, as water saving is 10-15%, chemical savings is 90-97%, maintenance is 30-50% less and energy savings is 9-16% vs. traditional chemical treatment (or 15-35% less vs. no treatment). Also, there is a huge positive impact on Health & Safety (as chiller ""punching"" using mechanical brushes and acid to remove scale deposits is hardly necessary vs. every year or two with traditional water treatment).",http://scalebuster.com,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities",2.0

The breakthrough is within valorizing all food waste and organics, from banana peels to chicken bones, as well as other typically unrecycled materials, like dirty plastics or packaging, all present in the everyday waste we produce today – simply by living. 



Our closed-loop process effectively reduces this residual household waste into many of its more basic natural components. Where, at an almost molecular level, these natural components reconstitute themselves and bind together to form a new homogeneous composite with thermoplastic properties. 



UBQ Materials upcycles composites which are sustainable, recyclable, and competitively priced for the marketplace today. They can be used to substitute conventional plastics within existing manufacturing systems without additional adaptation costs to make everyday familiar products industry produces today – just more sustainably, with a reduced carbon footprint. From Injection to compression molding through to extrusion, the UBQ™ material has been tested and proven to be compatible with PP, PE, PLA, and PVC. 



UBQ strategically positions its solution towards the end of the waste hierarchy. By doing so, we ensure that all recyclable materials are, in fact, recycled appropriately to maintain their inherent resource value. UBQ then diverts the waste ‘no one wants’ from landfills, and possible illegal dumping, giving it value again. Our robust modular system can be adapted to virtually any scale addressing both micro / local needs through to state and even national levels depending on waste generation and material off take demand.



As an innovative materials company, we seek to be part of the coalition that provides the missing link between waste disposal and new product manufacturing. Converting “waste” into commercially viable, valuable, and safe materials will allow industry to source and re-use wasted materials already in circulation rather than continue extracting our finite natural resources.



UBQ does have the potential to address the grossly underestimated impact of waste and growing need/demand for sustainable bio-based materials.

",Startup or self-employed,2018.0,170,innovator,Eric,NOTTEZ,,,,, France,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/snam-groupe/,,"The Snam Group holding company is a subsidiary of the Belgian group Floridienne (2,200 employees). It was created in 2018 to facilitate the capitalisation and development of its various subsidiaries :

   - Experienced companies, with high growth potential, such as SNAM, one of the European leaders in the recycling of batteries, SOPAVE and VCD (Vera Chimie Développement), all companies that have ambitious projects in the field of hydrometallurgy and chemistry; 

   - And the newly born subsidiary, Phenix Batteries, whose aim is to build a major European offer of 2nd life batteries for the market of stationary storage of intermittent renewable energies. 

  Today, Snam Group has 170 employees in France, spread over two sites : Decazeville / Aveyron and St Quentin-Fallavier / Isère. 

 

Now that electric mobility is expanding worldwide and appears to be a necessity in view of the global challenges of reducing carbon impact, now that many countries are developing voluntary programmes for the development of intermittent renewable energies and that therefore the question of their storage is arising, the activities of Snam Group, all devoted to batteries, are a perfect example of a circular economy, as well as a relevant and complete response to a crucial problem : the cost, management, life and recycling of the batteries involved in clean mobility (cars, buses, etc.) 



The development prospects of these markets will be very important, in Europe or worldwide, and the group is ready to face this challenge. Indeed, we have more than 40 years of experience in the battery recycling sector, and a large logistics power spread throughout the European continent - and beyond. For the past six years, we have developed, with the help of the CEA, measuring systems that allow us to accurately test the various components of the batteries we receive, and to select from them the modules we can reuse to store energy from IREC. We have also the confidence of many of the world’s leading car manufacturers with whom we have signed contracts for the recovery and recycling of their end-of-life batteries used in their hybrid or electric vehicles.



Nowadays, combining thermal and hydro-metallurgical processes, SNAM can recycle every battery chemistries (excluding lead). Its recycling rates are above 69% of the whole battery, a performance higher than the current European requirement for efficiency (50%). And as for the metals (Co, Ni, Li, Cu, Mn), the recycling rates are around 99%. Thus, SNAM produces 99% pure cobalt salts which can then be used for the manufacture of new lithium-ion batteries. 



For its part, the Phenix Batteries company manufactures 2nd life batteries, packaged in the form of standard modules packs that can be assembled, as needed, in cabinets or modular containers. The life extension of these batteries is around 7 or 9 years. The energy storage capacities of these new batteries can range from a few KWh to 2 MWh. These are new, tested, certified products that are guaranteed in contractual form, in terms of performance and service life, according to the conditions and characteristics of use required by the customer (number of charges and discharges, etc). 

The potential applications of these second-life batteries may be very varied : 

This can be a “stationary storage” type of use ; the batteries are then used to support the grid in cycles of high demand, or used to store energy produced intermittently in order to return it during the non-production phases (ex: return, at night, of solar energy; return, at day, of wind energy stored at night). 

Thanks to these batteries, it will also be easy for their users to optimise their electricity consumption rates, by storing it in low tariff periods and returning it in high tariff periods. 

Other possible applications : these batteries can be used in «inverter» function in order to avoid power cuts ; they can also be used to quickly recharge electric vehicles at terminals, etc. 

But whatever the function of these batteries, the activity deployed by Phenix Batteries will only take place within a B to B framework. The initial customers will be companies specialized in energy services (called integrators) and then, the energy companies, producers or distributors. 



All Snam Group’s activities are expected to create several hundred jobs in the 6 years to come.

About 40 % or 2000 million tons of the sectors emissions are in the form of methane (CH4), which is produced by the animal’s digestive process and released to the environment mostly by burping. A cow produces about 500 litres of methane gas per day or about 3 tons of CO2-eq. per year (source IPCC). Furthermore, it is important to know that methane’s greenhouse effect is twenty-five times stronger than carbon dioxide.

AGOLIN® RUMINANT is the company’s flagship product. It is a blend of high quality plant extracts from herbs and spices, which is effective, easy to use and safe. Research trials demonstrate AGOLIN’s potential to influence the rumen microbiota positively. The feed additive produces rumen responses, both in vitro and in vivo, such as reduced methane production, which leads to better energy utilization and consequently improved productivity in the animals. The product research was partially supported by EU research projects, with the goal to demonstrate a reduction of methane production in ruminants by the use of AGOLIN®, coupled to increased productivity, feed utilisation and animal wellbeing. A Climate-KIC (part of European Institute of Technology) research project demonstrated AGOLIN’s efficacy. Under the conditions of the long-term trial with over 150 cows carried out by the University of Aberystwyth in the United Kingdom, the feed supplement reduced the enteric methane production significantly by 20 % per kg milk, while feed intake (+3%), efficiency (+5%) and milk production (+9%) was improved. 

A scientific paper published in ‘Animals’ Journal, was based on over twenty trials

carried out over the last number of years, across nine countries and nearly

four thousand cows in total. This study was carried out by the The Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) near Madrid. The results not only show a significant benefit in terms of methane reduction from the rumen of the cow, but also in terms of milk production and feed efficiency. Methane emissions can be lowered by around 10%, according to the study, while energy corrected milk output and feed efficiency can be improved by over 4 percent.



AGOLIN’s concept and scientific proofs are well accepted for its economic and environmental benefits by the feed industry and farmers in Europe, North America and Asia. Furthermore, the food and feed industry developed successful carbon in- and offsetting projects with AGOLIN RUMINANT in Europe and North America (read more on www.agolin.com).



Feeding the world cattle population with AGOLIN®RUMINANT and reducing the average enteric methane production by 10 % (validated by Carbon Trust, independent low carbon and sustainability experts), would result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emission of 200 million tons CO2-equivalent per year.

To ensure the development of vegetation and offset the low fertility of urban soils, large quantities of topsoil are imported from surrounding agricultural or forest areas. Taking soil from rural areas for urban use is not sustainable as it is costly and comes with environmental risks: release of CO2, dust, petroleum consumption. Soil is not a renewable resource that can be excavated and easily transported from rural to urban areas without consequences. 

Also, the growth of urbanization increases the need for developing green infrastructure like parks, urban farming, side-street trees, … and human activities increase waste release, contamination, and soil degradation.

Microhumus fights soils degradation and sealing by applying innovative solutions. 

Using locally available materials or waste such as construction demolition waste, Microhumus builds fertile soils while respecting local regulations. These soils are engineered and designed to provide several ecosystem services based of the client needs.  

Both phytoremediation and engineered soils solutions rely on huge amount of scientifically approved litterature and research collaboration with a large number (10) of international research institutes and universities around the world.

THE CONTRAIL CLIMATE CHALLENGE:

Recent research shows that contrails formed by aircraft at cruise generate 59% of aviation’s climate impact, versus 32% arising from direct CO2 engine emissions. Future NetZero emission engines and fuels may exacerbate contrail formation as a result of higher water emissions. Contrail formation therefore presents the most significant climate challenge that aviation will face in the post-COVID19 era. SATAVIA is currently the only team offering a practicable solution to the contrail challenge.











OUR SOLUTION:

SATAVIA’s unique DECISIONX:NETZERO system uses AI-powered data analytics and enterprise-grade data to deliver actionable insight, enabling aircraft operators to accurately forecast, avoid, validate, quantify and offset aviation contrail emissions.



Pre-flight, operators can optimise flight plans to minimise contrail formation by targeting low-risk altitudes identified by SATAVIA modelling. Post-flight, DECISIONX:NETZERO validates contrail formation against modelled predictions and quantifies climate benefit, which is then converted into carbon offset credits for operators. With a conservative target of 50% contrail prevention, SATAVIA could enable annual emissions savings in excess of >1,000 Mt CO2e/year across all operators.



Alongside ongoing, incremental efforts to develop greener engines and fuels, DECISIONX:NETZERO offers a revolutionary, application-ready solution capable of targeting and minimising aviation’s most damaging environmental impact.



While SATAVIA’s vision centres on the goal of making aviation greener, the company also offers products focused on improving condition monitoring. SATAVIA’s DECISIONX:FLEET allows operators to improve asset condition monitoring (e.g. corrosion risks for parked aircraft) by ~10%, while also optimising engine core

During the day, solar panels power a village but also a pump which brings the water from a lower tank to an upper tank (declivity of +50 meters). When night falls, or when the electrical demand is too important, water goes down and activates a turbine, which will produce electricity and compensate for the lack of solar energy. This innovative but yet rustic solution is accessible for local users who can assure its maintenance and participate in civil works

We aim at developing sustainable and responsible projects, in accordance with communities and their surrounding environment, by considering local specificities and electrical grid constraints. Furthermore, the hybrid system developed by STEPSol goes beyond a simple green electricity production: it creates additional benefits to the people who host the installation. 



Principle of our “Hydraulic Battery” 



The solution developed by STEPSol combines the simplicity and rusticity of pumped hydro storage PHS, with a smart management of sun and water. 



During the day, solar panels power a village but also a pump which brings the water from a lower tank to an upper tank. When night falls, or when the electrical demand is too important, the water goes down and activates a turbine, which will produce electricity and compensate the lack of solar energy. Water acts as a “hydraulic battery”: it makes the solar production fully controlled and flexible.

Unlike other Na-ion batteries and due to its specific chemistry on positive and negative electrodes, Tiamat cell is designed for high power (30+ C in discharge and in charge) and ultrafast charge (5 min).



Tiamat technology finds its major applications in mobility (48V MHEV, 12V SLI, fast-charge ebus..) and stationary storage (grid frequency regulation), where high power needs are not satisfied by reference technologies.



In addition to weight reduction due to inferior cell quantity needed, Tiamat Na-ion offers cost pack advantages vs Li-ion based power & fast charge batteries, as its low self-heating allows to avoid pack cooling needs. Moreover, as far as safety is concerned, fire risks are dramatically decreased due to chemistry nature, and the possibility to store the cell at Zero Volt.



Its widely available raw materials makes the Na-ion cells best choice with respect to Environment concerns, societal and ethics topics, and strategic supplies.



Finally, Tiamat Na-ion’s superior life cycle (4000+ high rate cycles) makes it attractive when total cost of ownership (TCO) is considered.

Our operations network produces, distributes, and markets cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and related building materials, services, and solutions. 

Climate change represents one of the biggest challenges of our time, and its mitigation has been a priority for our company for many years. In 2020, CEMEX announced its Climate Action strategy, defining a global target of a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of cementitious products by 2030. For its operations in Europe, CEMEX also defined a 55% reduction target, in line with what the European Commission set as a new goal for all its member states.

We have an externally validated CO2 Reduction Roadmap to meet our 2030 goal. This roadmap assesses the carbon mitigation potential that can be seized across each of our cement manufacturing sites, taking into consideration local challenges, regulations, materials supply, technical limitations, and market dynamics, among other decisive factors.

To complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX also established an ambition to deliver Net-Zero CO2 concrete to all its customers globally by 2050. These targets are aligned with the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to reducing CO2 emissions and what is expected from the cement industry to contribute to the Paris Agreement.

At CEMEX, we support the urgency of collective action to achieve compliance with the Paris Agreement commitments and the fulfillment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on climate action.

They were looking for a simple to use, efficient and chemical free water treatment process and started to explore the concept of UV LED. 

UV disinfection has been a mainstay in water treatment plants for over 20 years, used to protect the public from harmful pathogens such as cryptosporidium.

Over that same timescale the world has seen a revolution in the white lighting industry with energy saving LEDs now the predominant light source everywhere from our homes and workplaces to our cars and bicycles.

However, by 2013 the only UV water treatment systems available which could treat largescale flowrates of water used mercury UV lamps which are power hungry, difficult to maintain, and contains toxic material.  

Though it had been discussed widely as a concept by UV System manufacturers, in 2013 Matt and Peter could not find a company with the capability to develop a UV LED System to meet their needs.

So, in 2014 Typhon Treatment Systems was founded to create one.

In the early years, the fledgling company battled with the development of a UV system which needed to be quite different to traditional mercury lamp systems. Until 2016 when the LED technology had developed to a point where it was feasible to build a full-scale reactor.

The BIO-310 was born and, with the aid of the United Utilities Innovation Lab, the first field trial were carried out in 2017.

By this time, the interest in what Typhon were doing was growing – from both water companies and competitors – but there was an important step required before Typhon could truly claim to have a product to sell.

3rd Party Validation is required as proof of a UV Systems performance capabilities before it can be sold to a water utility. Typhon completed the world’s first validation of a UV LED system – to the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) protocol – in July 2018. 

UV LED, for high flow rate, 24/7 operation applications had arrived.

Soon after the validation was complete Typhon was awarded a 10-year innovation framework by United Utilities and is currently in the process of installing a first commercial project and the world’s first Municipal UV LED installation at United Utilities Cumwhinton Water Treatment Works in Cumbria which, after some considerable COVID related delays will be completed in early 2021.

Some are dangerous to the health, all lead to a necessity of the cleaning of the processed materials. AFULudine was created to bring about a new solution. This company is based on the patented research works of three university researchers, each in their own field, Mr LALLEMAND in surface treatment, Mr MELOT in organic synthesis and Mr ROIZARD in tribology. The original idea came from Mr LALLEMAND, who thought of using a non-oily lubricant that would save the costly steps of cleaning the materials. The lubricant is made from water and/or alcohol plus the active ingredient, synthesized by the company. The process is in the metal treatment, as the active molecules will attach themselves to the surface, creating a thin layer on the metal. The main advantage is the fact that after the application, the solvent evaporates and leaves behind just our active molecules. This means after one application, you can work the material even if you spayed it up to 7 months beforehand. The lubricants are as good as the oils used today.

We manufacture the world's lowest water flush toilet, specifically for commercial / out-of-home use. Propelair uses only 1.5 litres of water per flush, much less than the UK average of 6-9 litres. Combining 1.5 litres of water and displaced air technology creates a powerful, high-performance flush which easily removes all waste with one flush. Washrooms generally account for around 90% of all water used in a commercial building. Because less water is needed, the Propelair system reduces the carbon footprint of the average toilet by up to 76% (by saving energy typically used at water treatment plants to process and pump water).  Propelair reduces water and sewage bills by up to 60%, thereby paying for itself in just 1-3 years. In addition to reducing water, energy and bills, Propelair also eliminates aerosolised germs (including Covid-19) by up to 95% thanks to a closed-lid flush, creating a more hygienic and healthier washroom environment for users. The powerful air-flush removes 95% of bacteria inside the bowl and antimicrobial additives in the handle further help reduce germs. Propelair quickly refills in 30 seconds compared to conventional systems which take 2-3 minutes, reducing queues, especially during periods of high usage. Propelair's robust design makes it well suited for high traffic washrooms in both corporate and high-traffic spaces and as such maintenance costs are reduced. It can be retrofitted into existing drains, requiring little to no refurbishment prior to installation. Propelair’s rimless pan and side hinges make previously hard-to-clean areas easily accessible, ensuring a thorough cleaning process can be carried out.

Every project information is transferred into the digital system, simulation results of different technologies are directly converted into a customer offer. In doing so, we are the first software solution that enables a combination of different technologies such as PV systems, battery systems, heat pumps and e-mobility.



Orders, the filling out of forms and the calculators work automatically and simplify the daily work of installers and energy suppliers considerably. Technical planning, design, dimensioning, cost calculation as well as simulation are integrated in one solution. The results are presented in customer-friendly quotations. This increases the sales quota by 30% and saves the installers / utilities up to 80% of time compared to traditional sales processes for small-scale renewable energy systems.



In addition, Eturnity acts as a digitization plattform that interconnects the very fragmented stakeholders of the renewable energy eco-system such as installers, utilities, suppliers, manufacturers, banks, insurances and lead generation providers.



Altogether and in its full potential, the Eturnity solution will reduce costs of small-scale renewable energy systems by up to 15%.

In Europe and North America, Hexem’s main users are in the food and beverage industry such as brew­eries, wineries, dairies and other producers of high strength wastewater. In developing economies, anyone producing wastewater benefits from the Hexem technology. While the wastewater market is large (more than CHF 100bn), the Hexem technology also reduces the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment.

Michael Siegert (founder and inventor) has developed a TRL 5 prototype in his workshop at the waste­water treatment plant in Le Châble, Valais, which can treat 200 l/day. The prototype is currently treating cheese whey produced by local cheese makers. The plant operator, Altis, the German engineering company Zahnen Technik and the British biofuel producer Wilson Biochemical have signed letters of interest. Hexem is currently looking for more partner to build further pilot plants.

Hexem was incorporated in October 2021 in Bagnes, Valais, Switzerland. Once seed funding of CHF 0.7M is secured, the co-founders Michael Siegert (CEO) and Miroslava Varničić (CTO) will begin team building, industrialization and marketing. Three to five pilot plants, financed by grants, will serve as demonstrators for Hexem’s future customers.

Initially, Hexem will not directly sell to the users of its technology. Hexem will work with local engineering firms to deliver its products to our users. The commercial Hexem technology is a wastewater treatment system called Hydrell System. It includes electrolysis reactors, optional methane storage and power conversion units. Hexem will start its business selling electrodes and service for these system as well as licensing its intellectual property. Once the company has gained sufficient market and technical expertise through sales and hires, Hexem will pursue a renting business model together with a financing partner.

(Hydrogen Injection System®) technology from Logikko injects hydrogen in small quantities into any thermal engine, generated in real time by electrolysis of water. The result is a reduction in consumption and pollution for gasoline and diesel engines.

The H.I.S. reduces fuel consumption up to 25% and toxic emissions up to 70% on any combustion engine.

Regarding diesel engines, the Logikko system is the only “on-board” solution currently on the market.



Logikko, created in July 2013, was based on the principle that the ecological transition would take place over the long term and that the emergence of electric vehicles would be gradual.



It took 6 years for this idea to become an economic reality accepted by the market.



The four-year period, between 2013 filing of the patent and 2017 when it is published, will have allowed Logikko to move from the stage of functional demonstrator to that of pre-production. During this period, expert assessment were organized and tests carried out on around 100 vehicles.



At Equip Auto 2019, Logikko was convinced that the market was finally here. The notion of energy and ecological transition was understood and economic and political players were beginning to admit that the market would not switch to all electricity in a few months, or even a few years.

All the players recognized the need to put in place transitional solutions in the replacement of the existing vehicle fleet.



Logikko had anticipated this change.



During the period 2017-2019 Logikko signed a partnership and support agreement for industrialization and production with a major automotive supplier.

Logikko systems have been audited by the CNRS. The result of this audit is a partnership agreement between Logikko and the CNRS for the development of new products with co-filing of patents. In this context, a doctoral student from the nanotechnologies unit of the Institute of Molecular Sciences of Bordeaux linked to a CNRS laboratory is working on the types of material of the electrolyzer as well as on the electrolyte.



Today Logikko ticks all the boxes in its value chain: Patent, Industrialization and Distribution.



Numerous developments resulting from this work are in progress in the sectors of passenger transport (Bus / Car, river shuttle), goods, public works, fishing, generators, airport, transport, production of green hydrogen for small gas storage units.



Logikko has built a solid team around basic businesses: electrochemistry, motorization, mechanics. Logikko completed its recruitment with complementary professions: methods, design, tests, etc.

Today Logikko enjoys a great capacity for development thanks to its quality recruitments.



VALUE PROPOSITION :

Today, Logikko has already created a product, the GreenPerformer, based on this technology for cars and light vehicles. Logikko develops, thanks to its partners, products based on our H.I.S. technology, adapted to each case: Heavy truck vehicles, coaches and buses; Construction machinery ; Shipyard ; Maritime and river transport; Large Gear; Fixed installation.

Thanks to our technology, individuals and professionals alike reduce their ecological impact. The H.I.S. meets 8 of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

The root cause of this problem is loose waste that occupies much more space than its actual volume. Garbage, in an uncompacted state, tend to overflow dustbins- and create an unhygienic atmosphere. They require frequent clearing, which ultimately increases the workload of health and sanitation workers. Garbage typically are then transported to open landfills further causing air, water and land pollution, adding to the health and environmental concerns. In most countries, only a fraction of the total garbage is sent for waste processing. The logistics cost is spent in garbage collection from door to door, waste processing centres, and landfill sites. Such collection trips are expensive due to the high number of trips required, fuel and labour cost involved, etc. The solution, RecycloBin is a smart waste compactor bin that aims at bringing efficiency in the current waste management systems by reducing waste volume at the source. RecycloBin can reduce space occupied by loose waste by at least 6 to 10 times as compared to regular dustbins.

Be it indoor or outdoor, overflowing dustbins are very common. The garbage typically is then transported to a landfill polluting air, after and land, and a fraction may be sent for waste processing.



In our analysis, we found out that the fundamental problem behind this problem is that loose waste occupies much more space than its actual volume. Additionally, they need frequent clearing, create an unhygienic and unpleasant atmosphere and cause health and environmental concerns. 

This in turn increases the workload of health and sanitation workers and waste transportation operators.



Did you know that most countries spend 60 to 70% of waste management funds on waste transportation alone? And this is because of the high volume that needs to be transported.

After spending so many funds on waste transportation, how much do you think is left for waste processing?



When we think about waste management, most of us think about recycling.

But imagine, along with reducing consumption of goods, if you were able to reduce the volume of waste that you are generating, at the source?



At Earthzy Technology, we help you achieve that.

With our flagship product, RecycloBin Waste Compactor Dustbin, we help reduce the volume of waste at the source. Typically waste is reduced by 6 to 10 times the original volume helping you save time, space, effort and tons of money.",http://recyclobin.com,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

Then, the mycelia are processed by using chromium-free natural dyes. The process doesn't involve animal killings and the mushrooms can grow in vertical farming while consuming less water and emiting low carbon emission.

Given won the bids, then the farm supplies the seeds produced to UN FAO & other NGOs such as ICRC, Save the Children, etc. Hence, these clients also redistribute seeds for about 1.5 million pro-poor farmers annually and these farmers are those poorest ones that cannot afford to purchase seed by themselves due to the lower-income level till now, these pro-poor farmers have been greatly benefited from the seeds they got in ensuring enhanced production & productivity in previous years and hence improve their overall livelihoods.

“Building as if with LEGO-Bricks!”



That meens: Building with prefabricated standard elements, made of 1/4 sustainable raw materials such as wood or bamboo and 3/4 of recycled paper that gets fossilized in a special process. These construction elements can be used like large LEGO bricks to build without architectural restrictions.



In this Process, every possible working Hour is shifted from the Construction Site to the Factory and built with high precision, but standardized Components.



Lightweight composite Technology is being used in this Process, as it already is in the Automotive and Aerospace Industries. Since a composite Element, consists mainly of a Core of Honeycombs in addition to a top and bottom cover Board, I focused on the Development of a Honeycomb, that can be manufactured quickly. With the “fossilized” Paper Honeycomb, which consists of 100% recycled paper and is provided with Mineral coating, I developed a new high-tech by low-cost Product. 



The standardized building elements can be used as Floor, Wall Ceiling and Roof Elements. Entire Houses can be built from these Components by simply plugging the together. The Aim is to reduce the Work of Craftsmen on the Construction Site, to a Minimum and the Assembly of the individual Components. In other Words, building as if with “LEGO-Bricks” and in such a way that the Houses are immediately habitable after Assembly.



In Germany alone, more than 650,000 People are Living on the Streets without Shelter, and more than 2.0 Million Homes are needed. This shows that the Construction of Housing, especially Social Housing, is no longer supported by Private Investors and is increasingly becoming the Responsibility of the individual States. The idea of ECOCELL is also to provide affordable living!



For Example, ECOCELL could save more than 35 Million tons of CO2 in the 1.5 Million Homes planned by the German Government, compared to solid Construction. This corresponds to the Annual CO2-Emissions of 20 Million Cars, i.e., half of all Cars registered in Germany. By using Bamboo instead of wooden boards, the CO2-reduction can even be increased.

Urged by the intensification of extreme climate events and the lack of micro-meteorological data, HD Rain's solution was developed to make individuals, companies and governments more informed, resilient and efficient when dealing with extreme weather events. 



Founded 4 years ago, by 2 doctors in meteorology and 1 engineer, HD Rain offers very high-resolution weather observations and forecasts for weather-sensitive zones and activities. Innovative at all levels of processes, the start-up opportunistically connects its sensors to lambda TV satellites to generate its data. The loss of signal in rainy days is measured, analyzed and coupled with artificial intelligence algorithms enabling the company to provide observations with a precision of 500m and forecasts of up to 2-hours in advance, both updated minute by minute on its precipitation maps. 



The system is therefore based on three pillars : 



1) Sensors | are autonomous, robust and efficient.

2) System |  uses artificial intelligence and deep learning.

3) Data | is high definition, precise and in real time. 



The 3 pillars combined offer an expert, ultra local and low cost solution to both developed and developing countries. Whether the goal is to add an additional set of data to existing infrastructures or to build up one in areas where weather data is non-existent, HD Rain's added value is multifaceted. 



The company offers 2 ways of collaboration. 

In the case where HD Rain sensors are already installed in a given area. The start-up offers monthly data subscription, with different levels of parameters (rain, temperature, humidity, pressure and soon snow and hail), data volume, insight and visualisation tools (web app or API). 

In the case where HD Rain is not present in the desired area, the start-up offers the opportunity to co-create a personalized project that answers the geographical, budgetary and technical challenges faced by the interested company. HD Rain implements projects in France and internationally, responding to various water-related issues. 



With a growing international network of 250 robust, HD Rain already collaborates with different clients coming from insurance (classic and parametric), agriculture, energy, water management, and public sectors. 2021, will be marked by HD Rain's massive deployment in the French Mediterranean Arc, with the goal of installing 1 000 sensors. In parallel, the company will keep working on its international projects in the Ivory Coast, Brazil and Georgia, with the hope to grow, widen its client's panel, and always provide the best possible data.

It is complicated for individual drivers and fleet operators to drive EVs effortlessly over long distances, across borders, or use them with high commercial intensity. This is because on-route charging is complex due to the different standards in plug-type, charge power, payment systems, waiting-lines, variable charge speeds, and outside variables like temperature, weather, topography, that impact the range of a battery.

Chargetrip offers smart route planning and navigation specific for Electric Vehicles (EV’s). This makes it easy for anyone, to use any EV beyond the range of the battery, operate fleets of EVs effortlessly, while simultaneously reducing operations costs.



How we do it:

Chargetrip develops an API-based SaaS platform for Electric Mobility. Our routing engine uses over fifteen different (dynamic) variables to calculate the real-time range of any electric vehicle (currently 246 EV models). Proprietary algorithms then compute the best route to a user’s destination, with the optimal charge stations in between, specific to their journey, business logic, and preferences. Build-in predictive models optimize for total travel time and travel costs. Chargetrip is easy to integrate into existing navigation- and telemetric fleet applications.



Traction:

Chargetrip has successfully implemented a number of EV-specific routing solutions. Our implementations include API services and front-end applications for:  

- EV-member organizations (e.g., Norwegian EV Association, ANWB), 

- Automotive Manufacturers (e.g., Porsche, Lightyear), 

- Charge Point Operators (e.g., EnBW, Iberdrola, EDP, Recharge), 

- Mobility Service Providers (e.g., Total, Autosense), and 

- Transportation Network Companies. 

Currently, over 175.000 EV drivers use our software every month, equal to 10% of all EVs in Europe.



Why it is important: 

The electric charge- and drive eco-system is extremely fragmented. It is complicated for individual drivers and fleet operators to drive EVs effortlessly over long distances, across borders, or use EVs commercially with high intensity. This is because on-route charging is complex due to the different standards in plug-type, charge power, payment systems, waiting-lines, variable charge speeds, and outside variables like temperature, weather, topography, that impact the range of a battery. 



These flaws in the ecosystem cause three adoption barriers for individuals and fleet operators; Range Anxiety, Charge Anxiety, and the TCO complexity of operating an electric fleet. We know that Smart EV Routing, including predictive models for charge-congestion, and dynamic energy prices, alleviates these barriers, and accelerates global mass adoption of electric mobility. In the coming years our API will help to optimize the TCO of EV fleets; owned, leased, rented, shared and autonomous.

There is a growing demand for green food packaging across the African continent primarily coming from the customers and changing government policies. With about 30 of 53 countries across the continent having introduced partial or full bans on single-use plastic packaging, restaurants and other food-related businesses are transitioning to greener more sustainable packaging. Plastic pollution has had adverse effects such as blocked drainage channels across most major cities that lead to frequent disease outbreaks.



With the growing need for sustainable packaging, all green packaging is imported from China and India. This leaves it much more expensive in comparison to conventional plastics. There is a need for a more cost-effective green sustainable packaging made from locally available bio-sourced materials.



Our solution.

At Hya Bioplastics, we have created a biodegradable packaging material from thermoplastic starch and fiber composites. We have been able to experiment and use a variety of plant fibers such as sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, banana stems as well as sawdust. For our starch source, we have been able to extensively experiment with cassava starch.



We have been able to design and fabricate our mini-pilot scale machinery in-house including a small extruder and a thermoforming machine to achieve our current production of about 50-100 trays per day. We have been in production for the past 3 months getting more than $1000 in revenue for our vegetable and fruit trays.

Currently, massive investments are made to develop and build renewable energy solutions like wind turbines and solar panels. Once their exploitation phase started, these solutions indeed provide an energy that is from a renewable source and do not release Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 

But in order for a solution to be truly sustainable, all the phase of it's life cycle need to be taken into account. That's why it is important for our future to rely on energy solutions that actually produce way more energy during their life cycle than what is required for their sourcing, production and disposing/recycling phases. Moreover, it is important for a solution to be respectful of its direct environment and not impact the wildlife.



VH quatrevingtreize was launched in 2017 with the conviction that a true sustainable future was possible. Therefore, we set the following environmental criteria for our products:

- Production of renewable energy

- Way more energy produced during the exploitation phase than the energy required for the production and the recycling phase

- Environmental friendly and not harming the wildlife

- Easy public acceptance



We produce biosourced and fully recyclable hydropower solutions that can extract energy from :

- rivers and estuaries

- tide

- Waves



The technology is based on our patented soft blade Savonius rotor. the upside of this rotor is the fact that it can harvest energy from the different sources mentioned above and its efficiency is doubled compared to a classic Savonius rotor. Moreover, its slow and smooth rotation does not harm the fish or birds living in the exploitation area.  It can even work as a wind turbine in order to produce hybrid sea solutions (wind/wave).

This is the result of Stephan Guignard's research at Aix-Marseille University then the maturation of the technology with the SATT Sud-Est in France. 

this technology is labelled ""greentech verte"" and has won different innovator competitions.



All our solutions are made from a local biosourced material which is a mix of pine needles and linen fiber. This material allows us to fully recycle our modules into new ones.



The simplicity of the technology and its biosourced material allow our solutions to have an economic and energetic Return on Investment lower than 5 years.

Coomtech is a UK based industrial technology company. Our easy to implement patented bulk industrial materials drying technology reduces energy costs and emission generated by our clients, supporting the drive to NET ZERO, today.



We have developed an easy to use, better way to dry bulk raw materials that reduces the amount of energy & costs required and emissions generated by some 75% when compared to traditional equipment across this $75bn+ global sector.



We are surrounded by materials that required drying before use in products we recognise in everyday life.  Examples of the industries using these bulk raw material ingredients include cement, mineral production, pharmaceuticals, food, energy including   battery manufacture and recycling, construction and many more in these global and growing market sectors. 



The world needs to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted now, but many of the most used and essential materials generate a significant volume of emissions when being processed.  Coomtech reduces the emission generated by these critical industries - today. Immediate, significant incremental change towards Net Zero, not waiting for a silver bullet!



A good example is cement.  This is the second most used material after water and requires significant energy to manufacture.  There is not currently a viable alternative to cement on the horizon, so finding ways to reduce the impact of this material whilst an alternative is developed is critical. 



•	Over 4.2 Billion tonnes of cement are used globally.



•	At 1.25t CO2/1 mt cement = 5.2 Billion tonnes of CO2 emitted annually



If the cement industry were a country it would be the third global emitter after USA and Russia according to recent BBC research.



Impact and efficiency in one simple act: Coomtech reduces the drying energy required by up to 75%, and in doing so reduces the amount of CO2 emitted by the same amount.  



New build plants, capacity expansion or general efficiency upgrades are three of the key initial opportunities for this technology.  In the future we see opportunities to supply our equipment to plant builders as a component and to license the technology to other equipment manufacturers.



Currently we have a initial plant going to Australia in the clean fuels sector,  several opportunities including a co-development programme in construction materials and  a joint development programme for the pharmaceutical industry all under way. 



How It Works:

The Coomtech SMR process uses managed, aggressive, turbulent air to shear water off the particle surface.  Moisture is stripped from the particles by: 

•	a centrifugal force caused by the spinning of the particles;

•	a linear force pneumatically induced by the particles travelling at different speed to the basic air flow. 

Conveying air is maintained at an average 85degC, the optimal moisture carrying condition to aid transport of removed moisture away primarily as vapor, aerosol and some droplets.  In the under 1 second a particle is processed the warm air does not contribute directly to drying. 



This process is in contrast to traditional thermal drying which has to conform to the natural laws of thermodynamics dictating a specific amount of heat to vaporise a given amount of water.

Its purpose is to replace on selected applications the ‘classic’ atmospheric hydraulic reservoir (tank)

The VVR  targets many applications like industrial hydraulic systems, mobile machinery, military vehicles, mining machinery, marine and offshore field inluding ROV's fluid power systems.

It can be from open loop systems to hydrostatic drives.

In conventional systems, the reservoir oil capacity is sized in relation to the pump flow rate (typically 2-3 times) whereas the VVR  solution requires to size from the system oil displacement and thermal expansion. Displacement could be from differential cylinders where the rod volume  only  must be accounted for .

Main return flow goes direct to pump inlet where the VVR connected to the return line will compensate for volume differential and thermal expansion, thus making the VVR totally independent from system flow.

The VVR is not part of the cooling equation; hence, classic reservoir offers very poor cooling capacity. 

It is in our philosophy that the coolers must provide 100% if this task. Why use a bulky heavy mass of fluid to obtain the same result...it is not ecological !

The VVR is sealed, airless and slightly pressurized thus offers many benefits over classic heavy & bulky reservoirs;

-	 Considerable weight reduction  (up to 100 times)

-	 Considerable space reduction ( up to 20 times)

-	 Reduced fluid cost thus 100 times less fluid

-	 Environment friendly and mostly suitable for biodegradable fluids

-	 Open loop system becomes a closed loop system

-	 Exposure to solid contaminants and moisture (oxidation) is eliminated

-	 Increased fluid and components life thus lower maintenance cost and increased system reliability

-	 Reduced contamination risk when filling

-	 Reduced oil disposal volume / recycling

-	 Reduced fire hazards and consequences

-	 Reduced decontamination cost if a major leak  occurs ( environmental hazard)

-	 Pump positive inlet pressure allows machine to operate in any orientation and altitude

-	 Pump positive inlet pressure reduces pump noise and allows for better performance and increased RPM.

-	 VVR’s can be installed in series or parallel to increase effective volume 

-	 VVR’s can be installed on independent pump to isolate circuits.



When applied on mobile machines, their 100:1 weight reduction allows for better fuel eonomy and /or higher payload.



VVR's can operate on top of Everest down to seafloor with same performance.

Coffee brands are increasingly searching for ways to increase the recycling rate of these capsules. The current way of recycling by the consumer is unpractical, unhygienic and not efficient. The Coffeecoiner is a kitchen tool that fits in your cutlery drawer or next to your coffee machine. The tool serves the purpose to remove used  coffee grounds from the used capsule. What remains is a flat disc of aluminum, called the Coffeecoin. The coffee grounds can be used for several household, garden and cosmetic purposes. The Coffeecoins can be melted into any new aluminum product, as aluminum does not degenerate when recycled. In this way waste is turned into a resource. The Coffeecoiner itself is made from recycled aluminum.

We are commercializing and scaling a thermochemical process that converts waste streams, such as municipal solid waste, sewage sludge and plastics, into clean hydrogen without incineration. The process produces its own fuel and heat, is carbon-neutral by itself and carbon-negative when paired with carbon capture and storage. We are exploring partnerships with carbon capture and storage companies to achieve negative carbon emissions.



The growing volumes of trash and unrecyclable plastic causing problems around the world can be upcycled to produce a major portion of the world’s clean energy resources. Countries around the world can thus increase their use of hydrogen for mobility, power generation, energy storage and other applications tapping their own, local, resources.



Ways2H aims to improve the global environment by eliminating waste while producing carbon-negative renewable hydrogen. There’s an urgent need to scale up clean hydrogen production to replace fossil fuels used for mobility, power generation and industrial applications.

Thanks to the proprietary technology developed by SOP’s founder, the company has developed farmer oriented solutions that could enable faster climate policies.



Its products for crop systems and livestock operations interact with the microbial and biological activity of soils, plants, and animals and enable stable and consistent yields while reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.

SOP solutions include products:

• for CROPS, which help farmers reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, lowering inputs costs and mitigating the environmental impact of intensive cultivation of staple crops, including corn, wheat, soy, rice, alfalfa, and cover crops;

• for ANIMALS, which enhance overall health, improve feed conversion efficiency, and reduces costs of operations, while improving the production of milk, meat, and eggs;

• for WASTE MANAGEMENT, which reduce odors, ammonia emissions, and greenhouse gases, while mitigating the impact livestock waste on the environment and the surrounding communities.

The efficacy of the products has been established through scientific studies conducted by several of universities, including UC Davis, Cornell, University of Milan, Guelph, and the University of Piacenza.

SOP LAGOON, the product for manure lagoon management, was studied for its ability to reduce ammonia and GHG emissions from dairy liquid manure. The results of this study were published in September 2019 in the international peer reviewed journal called “Sustainability.”

SOP products are currently distributed in North America and Europe, enabling farmers to achieve sustainability within intensive agriculture across economic, environmental and social impacts.",http://sopgroup.com,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",2.0

This method guarantees 100% recovery of the repaired object’s functionality, at least 98% of its original strength and a very similar appearance. Thanks to this method, customers benefit from a 70% cost reduction in comparison to the purchase of a new item and from a 98% carbon emission reduction compared to alternative solutions. 



BENEFITS

- SIGNIFICANT SAVING COSTS: around 70%, if the customers repair their damaged goods instead of buying new ones. Example: the cost of a new pallet that weighs 18,20kg is around 40-60€ and, to be repaired by PRS, it requires only 100 grams of plastic welding material. The cost of the repair is about  30% of the cost of buying a new pallet (only 1/3 of a new item!).

Thanks to PRS repairing service, one of the leaders of the sector of can producers was able to save €1M and almost 800 tons of CO2 at the same time and, even more, they were able to create 9 new jobs for disabled people in just one year.

-CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION:  repairing and reusing plastic goods emits 220 times less CO2 than recycling, burial or cremation of those items. Plastic waste and its negative impact on the environment is reduced, decreasing the carbon footprint. 

We have estimated the carbon footprint savings of our activity from the data extracted from study “Environmental impact analysis of pallet management” (A. Mazeika). The CO2 footprint per kilo of plastic disposed will be: 0.22680kg/CO2 when recycling, 0.92986 kg/CO2 when landfilling, and 1.42428 kg/CO2 when incinerating. And we also should add to this figures the CO2 emitted during the plastic production process to replace the discarded item, which would be 3.5kg/CO2 per kilo of plastic. On the other hand, repairing 1 kilo of plastic would emit 0.02039kg of C02 and as the repaired item would be ready to use, it wouldn’t be necessary to manufacture a new one. To sum up and as an example, recycling (which will be the second most environmentally friendly alternative to repairing) and replacing one pallet of 18,20kg would emit 67.828kg/co2 while repairing it would just emit 0.371kg of co2. So that is why we can say that repairing is 182 times much better than recycling and repairing it.

In the last two years PRS has achieved a retention of 12.519 tons of CO2 which would have been emitted by other alternative solutions different from repairing, such as recycling, landfilling or incinerating.

- 9 YEARS EXPERIENCE: through the last 9 years the company has developed an industrialized process that allows to offer short delivery times to guarantee quality. PRS also has set up a net of almost 20 facilities in Spain and one more in Mexico and is also planning to open new workshops in Europe in 2020.



-RELIABILITY: we should also stress the fact that PRS has his own patented and certified method. Two well-known independent technical institutes in Spain, such as AIMPLAS and CEMITEC, agree on certifying that a plastic good repaired under our method recovers 100% its functionality and at least 98% of its strength. Furthermore, Plastic Repair works under ISO quality standards (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001).

In addition, one of PRS clients, which is the largest pooling company in the world, carried out demanding test on the PRS repaired pallets in USA which validated the reparation quality. 

On the other hand, the materials used in the repair are perfectly suitable for food use. And also the exact colour of the wire can be chosen, which guarantees the aesthetical quality of the repaired items. 

-  INDUSTRY SPECIALIZATION: PRS is repairing pallets, crates, frame tops, boxes, etc. for large companies from different sectors. Just in the last year has repaired more than 100,000 products of companies such as Chep, Crown, Campofrío or Mahou.

-CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: as PRS is a company that enables the labour and social inclusion of people with disability, PRS contributes to the integration of disabled people in the labour market, reaching agreements with different Authorized Workshops that are Special Employment Centres. Apart from that, the activity of repairing equipment and plastic goods makes PRS a Circular Economy Company.

As a recognition of the social and environmental impact of PRS project, our company has won different prizes and awards. Those are helping PRS to position ourselves better in the circular economy industry:

· PRS has been included as one example of best practice in Circular Economy by the EU Commission.

· PRS won the first prize in the European Business Awards for the Environment 2018 in Spain.

· The interest and novelty of this project has been recognized by EU: PRS has been awarded in the Product&Services European Business Awards for the Environment, 14/Nov/2018 in Vienna (Austria).

· PRS was invited by the Commission to participate in the Circular Economy Mission to Mexico 24/April/19.

Compared to conventional pumps, not only does it save a lot of energy, but it also saves the lives of countless fish that migrate through the pump. Indeed, migrating fishes have the possibility to pass through the displaced water to find their way out of the polder, but approximately 15% of all fish that utilise this transport route suffer some kind of damage in conventional screw pump. The FishFlow Innovations' screw pump has a design that does not inflict any damage on passing fish. The blades do not stretch across the full width up to the tip of the screw, instead the width of the blades gradually decreases from the middle outwards during the last few windings. The second adaptation concerns the housing of the screw, which is enclosed in a pipe that is attached to the screw and thus rotates together with it which also ensures no water leakage. These adaptations transformed the screw pump into a fish-friendly facility for downstream migration.","April 30, 2021",FishFlow Innovations,Netherlands,Medium and large scale commercialization,"Network, New clients, Visibility, Funding, Partners",BusinessWater Utility,"Rivers, Water pumping","Water, Water supply",https://youtu.be/n0YZpIhX5ck,"0% water losses;80 - 100% hydraulic efficiency;80 years life time expectancy;100% fish friendly  ;At least 30% energy savings, compared to conventional pumps;95% Recyclable;","80% reduction on maintenance costs;Installed in 1 day;At least 30% energy savings, compared to conventional pumps;","Europe,Australia","United Kingdom,Netherlands,New Zealand","OSMOSUN: A sustainable, flexible energy source for affordable and renewable water for all (Water);WATA™ technology: Devices to enable local treatment and disinfection of water (Water);Purifaaya: Locally-produced water filters for the production of safe drinking water in uganda (Water);Elemental Water Makers: Desalination system powered by renewable energy (Water);",https://solarimpulse.com/companies/fishflow-innovations,FishFlow Innovations,481_C,We work on the forefront of innovation and technology to take products from an idea all the way to the end consumer.,Company,2006.0,15,innovator,Gerard,Manshanden,,,,, Netherlands,https://facebook.com/fishflow-innovations-333508940025836,https://twitter.com/_Fishflow_,https://nl.linkedin.com/in/gerard-manshanden-4a21453b,,"FishFlow Innovations develops and builds innovative fish migration facilities and protection systems.

This typically comes at a high energy cost, which is in turn typically produced from non-renewable sources. In certain industries and buildings, such as hotels for tourism or hospitals for healthcare, air-conditioning is frequently the largest single usage of energy, representing up to 40% of total consumption. This solution aims to drastically reduce the amount of energy consumed to produce air conditioning while using a renewable natural source of cold. The solution could be implemented anywhere with suitable bathymetry and easy access to deep ocean water and strong AC needs. The concept of the solution is to give the opportunity to have cool air when needed, while considerably decreasing the energy consumption and our carbon footprint. The solution is a Sea Water Air Conditioning (SWAC) system. This system permits to save about 42% of energy comparing to a conventional AC system. It uses the temperature of the deep ocean to cool an AC loop, releasing seawater back to the ocean with no impact. This solution sends a 2,6km piping into the ocean to reach a 930m deep area. The impact on the environment is very low and safe - It provides air conditioning using the cold of the deep ocean.","April 30, 2021",PACIFIC BEACHCOMBER,French Polynesia,Initial market commercialization,"Network, Visibility, Partners, Credibility","BusinessServicesBuildings Operators, BusinessServicesHealthcare & Medical Institution

The Brando was inspired by Marlon Brando’s original vision to create a venture of sustainable development that resonates with visitors and fosters opportunities to get to know both the place and people of French Polynesia. He was passionate about preserving Tetiaroa’s natural beauty, biodiversity and cultural richness and was determined to find a way in which it could be a center for research and education and a model of sustainability. 

In 2006, the InterContinental Bora Bora Resort & Thalasso Spa opens, with 96 overwater bungalows and 12 dayrooms. It is the first hotel in the world to use a pioneering system of deep-sea water air-conditioning (SWAC), which is also used in the Thalasso, Deep Ocean Spa, installed within the hotel. 

In 2009, PBSC begins construction of The Brando on Tetiaroa.

In 2010, PBSC acquires the 38-bungalow Maitai Rangiroa, located on one of the largest lagoons in the Southern Hemisphere. 

In 2011, The Maitai Lapita Village in Huahine opens under the management of Hotel Management Services (HMS), a subsidiary of PBSC. 

In 2011, PBSC sucessfully implements the 2nd SWAC installation on Tetiaroa. The pipe is the deepest in the world at 930 meters.

In 2014, PSBC opens The Brando on July 1, 2014. 

The Brando is a unique luxury resort on French Polynesia’s breathtakingly beautiful private island of Tetiaroa – an atoll composed of a dozen small islands surrounding a sparkling lagoon 30 miles northeast of Tahiti. The Brando offers carefree luxury in the midst of pristine nature. With access to the island by private plane, the resort features 35 villas on white-sand beaches frequented by sea turtles, manta rays and exotic birds. The resort was designed to reflect Polynesian lifestyles and culture. 

We consider ourselves stewards of Tetiaroa, and believe that we have the responsibility to treat it with the highest level of care and respect. Almost all of Tetiaroa is being protected and preserved forever in its natural state. We have touched the motu on which the resort sits as lightly as possible. The Brando and all the villas have been designed without beach obstructions to blend harmoniously into the trees. According to our LEED Platinium Certification, we have used local materials extensively in the design and construction. All building materials used are of local or certified origin, renewable, or incorporate recycled components. Furthermore, we are using a pioneering deep seawater air-conditioning system to reduce energy demands and we rely mainly on renewable energy provided by solar panels. Setting a new world standard, the resort is close to reach its goal of being carbon neutral and self-sustainable. We have built and gifted an Ecostation to Tetiaroa Society, the nonprofit organization established to lead the scientific and cultural mission to protect the atoll and to inspire sustainable interdependence on Tetiaroa and around the world.",http://www.pacificbeachcomber.com/,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

But to be competitive, hydrogen fuel cells need to extend their life time, reduce their weight, while being compact. As of today, unfortunately, current materials can not fulfil all those targets at the same time.

Bipolar plates represent 70% of the fuel cell stack system, for 30% of its cost, and are the main reason for low durability of fuel cell stacks. HYCCO has developed high-performance composite bipolar plates that are thinner, lighter and more resilient than any other available materials.

I have had over a decade of experience in the denim industry moved to China in 2011 and have lived in shanghai ever since. As a designer, I worked closely with many Chinese denim factories. I witnessed first hand the mass production of denim jeans for the ever growing market across the world and the subsequent negative impact this industry has on the environment. 



The idea for UseDem came about when I was asked to clear a showroom of jeans and discard them. I told myself I couldn’t throw them away, instead, I used them... or Usedem. The jeans got sent to her flat where she started cutting and experimenting to see what she could make, eventually creating the Buddy Bag. 



UseDem has one primary aim: to eliminate textile waste. We believe that upcycling is a possible solution to the textile industry’s pollution. Not only this, but by reusing and reshaping old jeans, we can transform the consumer based mindset of our society. 



What we do:

We source used jeans from individuals as well as discarded jeans and fabric from factories and upcycle them into unique, beautiful and marketable products. We allow you to take a pair of jeans that you’re connected to, that have your stories embedded in them and 

that fit your shape and your style and remake them into something perfect and unique to you. As Xenia puts it; “we give the material a chance to live again”.



Our bags and accessories are made in partnership with Home Sweet Home, who operate our factory on the outskirts of Shanghai. They are a not-for profit organisation which provides training and employment for Chinese people with special needs or disabilities.  



We are challenging the perhaps negative connotations with the term Made in China as our products are Remade in China. We take preexisting fabric, produce high quality, recycled and upcycled products in a sustainable process. 

In one year, Usedem saves approximately 400 pairs of jeans from landfills, equivalent to saving almost 4.4 million litres of water! 



Let’s use them! Usedem

The board material has been shown to exhibit excellent properties, which are comparable with or even superior to commercial wood based panels. Our product is stronger and more durable, priced considerably less, and greener. Coconut husk has the highest lignin content of any known plant and this helps the raw material to bind into a hard board without the addition of any damaging glue or binder. Due to its strength the board has the potential to be used for structural elements in buildings. It also has natural anti-fungal properties and burns three times slower than wood. The method is sustainable and environmentally friendly. The residual material of the coconut is used in its entirety. It is a good alternative to wood and helps to prevent deforestation. During production, glue and chemical agents do not need to be added. Furthermore, the production is CO2 neutral. It is inexpensive. The glue that has to be added when boards based on wood fibre are made contributes to one third of the total production costs. Glue is not required to process coconut husk into board material.

Taken separately, each material can often be recycled or reused, but the separation process can be costly or sometimes impossible, especially when shredding processes are involved. The TPS process is an efficient, fast and sturdy technology based on existing industrial supercritical processes. The solvents used, coupled with supercritical CO2, allows to delaminate the different layers of the wastes' materials (glues and bonds at the interface of materials are dissolved). The TPS process is a clean chemical process using mainly supercritical CO2 for the separation of multi-layer complex wastes and products, to enable their recycling.

has been developing a large scale water pump that does not require the use of electricity. 



 Solely powered by a hydraulic head as the renewable energy source,  we can supply the necessary pressure to treat millions of liters of water per day to filter polluted water bodies all over the world and provide clean drinking water to less fortunate people.  Other than that our solution can supply water for irrigational purposes several km away since it is also a volumetric pump. 



After depositing an international 3 party PCT patent, SAS UP-Welling was created and in April of 2019, The Up-Welling team has been laureates at the International Inventions Exposition in Geneva, where we received the gold medal in the category for Energy as well as the INPI France prize amongst others.



The local municipal water authority, La Créole, is in charge of managing water for several municipalities on the west side of the island including Saint-Paul with over 100 000 inhabitants. They have asked the Up-Welling team to show the efficiency of our pumping solution by using the wastewater of a wastewater treatment plant in Cambaie. We installed our pump as close as possible to the lowest point and it provided a 24m dynamic head. 

The pump provided enough pressure to pump 2000m3 of the 5000m3 daily wastewater back up to the treatment plant with a supplementary pressure of 2,5 bars that are used in a tertiary micro-filtration unit. Showing thus the possibility of permanently recycling water with water as the renewable energy source without the need for electricity or PV systems nor wind generators which are intermittent power sources. 



Some installation examples.



1 - Pumping and filtering polluted surface water.



The demonstration done at La Créole, proved that without the use of expensive electricity, it was possible to provide the necessary pressure and volume to filter polluted water.

Depending on the case study, with regards to the topology of the region, water from a polluted river or water body can be treated by using a membrane filter station that will be placed close to the pump. We can even pump raw water up to a water tower and then use gravity to filter the water.    

Some filtration units make use of hollow fibers with integrated backwash. Thereafter compressed air is used to complete the rinsing cycle. T This air can also be provided by the UP-Welling pumping solution.



2- Filling high altitude reservoirs. 



High altitude terrains situated above water sources can benefit from such a pumping solution by filling reservoirs for distribution. This way agricultural land can be optimized even without electricity around. 

Future demonstrations.

The Up-Welling pumping solution should find its main application in thousands of towns and villages all over the world. 

It is important to demonstrate how polluted water can be filtered at an affordable price for less fortunate people 





Since maintenance only requires the replacement of seals not so often, it can be carried out with the use of simple tools and spanners.

Two people are enough for a maintenance routine.

Air pollution from motorized mobility in cities harms the health of the inhabitants and jobs in the automotive industry are shifting to Asia. These are some of the reasons which led to the development of the Clean Vehicle Directive (DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/1161). According to this directive, municipalities are forced to reach procurement targets of clean and energy-efficient vehicles. This is a huge challenge for municipalities, as existing alternatives to diesel buses are not always suitable or are extremely expensive. In order to meet the needs of these municipalities, CMF recovers their old buses and remove all diesel components like tanks, engine etc. and install the patented CMF drive. It consists of an electric drivetrain with an onboard charger and enables 3-fold energy savings: Through the recovery of braking energy, usage of engine waste heat and constant optimal load at the on-board charger. Thanks to upcycling, CMF avoids the production of unnecessary material. The CMF drive runs on liquid natural gas (LNG), Bio-LNG or synthetic natural gas.

Ciò è particolarmente importante a causa del costo elevato dei pallet di dimensioni non standard. Il design si concentra sul rispetto dei requisiti standard in termini di capacità di spedizione, nonché su un sistema di connessione molto sicuro e protetto per il nesting dei pallet.

Le dimensioni dei pallet Ponera sono progettate tenendo conto delle diverse fasi del processo di spedizione, al fine di massimizzare l'efficienza del trasporto aumentando la quantità di merce trasferita in contenitori standard. Inoltre, i materiali utilizzati per i nostri pallet sono considerati biopolimeri riciclabili che offrono una maggiore sostenibilità. L'utilizzo di questo materiale garantisce la possibilità di riutilizzare i pallet più volte (la durata di vita stimata è di oltre 10 anni) rispetto ai pallet in legno di dimensioni personalizzate che vengono generalmente utilizzati una sola volta, creando un grande spreco di risorse.

Al giorno d'oggi, i pallet in legno vengono utilizzati principalmente per la spedizione di merci. Anche se esistono pallet definiti convenzionali, come i pallet europei o americani, gran parte di questo mercato comprende merci di dimensioni personalizzate, ad esempio nel caso del trasporto di attrezzature industriali o di mobili. 

Il problema dei pallet di dimensioni personalizzate è che sono molto più costosi rispetto ai pallet convenzionali. Ciò è dovuto principalmente al costo di produzione di questi pallet, poiché non vengono prodotti in grandi quantità. Il secondo problema è che questi pallet vengono solitamente utilizzati una sola volta nel loro ciclo di vita, in quanto vengono rottamati alla fine del trasporto, il che offre una sostenibilità molto bassa, sia economica che ambientale.

I pallet convenzionali, d'altra parte, hanno il problema di non essere ottimizzati per ottenere la massima efficienza di trasporto, come ad esempio la massimizzazione della superficie utilizzata dei contenitori standard per il trasporto a secco. Tali pallet sono stati standardizzati in un periodo compreso tra gli anni '40 e '60 e sono ottimizzati principalmente per ridurre i tempi di carico richiesti o semplicemente per adattarsi alle porte degli edifici residenziali. La soluzione che offriamo è progettata per affrontare le sfide sopra citate. 

Inoltre, il concetto di modularità del nostro sistema di pallet ci permette di fornire soluzioni IoT, dotandole praticamente di soluzioni di tracciabilità, e crea i presupposti per un'efficiente economia circolare con un modello di soluzione unico per tutti. Il design e il concetto della soluzione Ponera sono un fattore abilitante per le iniziative di Physical Internet, garantendo una soluzione che consente un incapsulamento flessibile delle merci. Grazie a questa caratteristica, che combina la flessibilità (d'uso e di dimensioni) con soluzioni di tracciabilità, siamo nella posizione ideale per affrontare ulteriori mercati come il trasporto di merci di dimensioni convenzionali (grazie all'aumento dell'utilizzo di spazio nei container) e aumentare la nostra offerta futura di soluzioni digitali per gestire efficacemente il flusso dei moduli.

Infine abbiamo sviluppato il design e la selezione del materiale per il prodotto. Il progetto ha superato i test di simulazione per soddisfare i requisiti dei mercati a cui vogliamo rivolgerci. Il primo prototipo è in fase di produzione e abbiamo organizzato un test pilota nel primo trimestre del 2021 con un'azienda in Svizzera, e puntiamo a 3-4 progetti pilota in totale, in diversi settori e per diversi usi. Abbiamo depositato due domande di brevetto presso l'Ufficio Europeo dei Brevetti nel gennaio 2019.

Acquiring environnmental data is a complex task. Especially when georeferencing is required. To build maps and monitor evolution of coastal area (climate change, erosion, posidonia field evolution,...) complex surveys are usually required, involving heavy ships and dedicated highly qualified staff just to get data in situ about ocean depth and seabed nature (sand, vegetation, rocks, ...). Monitoring is often required to measure the evolution fo the environnment after various climate events, human activity (ships in harbor moving sediments with propellers), currents and seasons. Thus, several mobilizations, transportations, and operations are planified to fullfill the need for environnemtal data.

 (Buildings & Shelters);",https://solarimpulse.com/companies/carbon-cut-uk-limited,CARBON CUT UK LIMITED,537_C,"Carbon Cut has designed a Cavity tray that can be easily fitted inside most cavity walls, it locks in place thanks to its patented technology and allows an easy insulation of the external wall without disruption.",Startup or self-employed,2011.0,2,innovator,Chris,Riggs,,,,,"Alner Rd, Blandford Forum DT11 7FJ, UK",,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/carbon-cut-uk-limited,537_P,"The Carbon Cut system has been developed by Chris Riggs (builder/developer/energy assessor for 30 years) to overcome the economic and technical problems of retrofitting insulation into cavity walls of houses, flats, and other multi-storey buildings. 

The system is unique in that it enables cavity wall insulation of properties that were previously difficult or impossible to insulate. 

This has included support for technical and market input from such organisations as The Technology Partnership of Coventry and Portsmouth Universities. These studies and reports have confirmed that Carbon Cut is a viable product from technical, energy efficiency and sustainability perspectives.

The system comprises of a retrofit horizontal cavity wall tray and a unique insertion system, which enables older flats and multi-storey buildings over 12m high (Building Regulation limitation for continuous cavity) to have economic and insured cavity wall insulation installed and to achieve substantial energy savings. It also overcomes the issues of insulating cavity wall buildings that have cellars, as the system holds the insulation above the damp course, something not possible before. 

At present, the maximum permitted height, for a continuous cavity to be retrofitted with insulation, is three floors (12M). This is because of potential frost damage, and/or condensation/rain penetration could cross the cavity and make the living space damp if an attempt is made to go higher. 

The Carbon Cut system overcomes these problems by using its unique design to collect the water and divert it out through the boundary wall thus reducing “bridging” (water transference across the cavity) and the associated damp risk on the internal walls of the cavity, and by reducing frost damage to the outer walls.  In addition, the system does not create further cold spots. 

The system provides a barrier which can close any part of a cavity completely, independent of height. Thus, when used with readily available Bead/Fibre insulation material, this provides a cost-effective way to achieve an insured insulated wall.

The Company has developed, and holds patents for, the unique Retrofit Horizontal Cavity Wall Barrier (cavity tray) that can easily and economically be fitted to any new/existing buildings.

A further aspect on the benefits of the Tray, it is made from recycled plastic, it is our intention to create a large demand for plastic waste, hopefully improving the environment problem of waste plastic.

Carbon Cut is in the final stages of British Board of Agreement (BBA) (buildings regulator UK and EU) for the system, which will ensure acceptance with UK/EU specifiers, building control, local authorities, and insurers. The proof-of-concept pilot has met or exceeded the requirements of all the BBA tests carried out to-date (trading can begin). There is a high level of confidence and probability that the system will achieve approval for scale within the next year.



The market opportunity is being helped by legislation that come into force in 2018, meaning that private landlords of flats and houses will be forced to upgrade the insulation of their flats and houses from Category F or G by at least two levels. Also, energy companies must meet carbon reduction and ECO3 targets, every building insulated reduces heating/cooling energy consumption and carbon emissions by 30%+.

 Failure (Landlords) to achieve this means they will be unable to create new leases on such properties

Currently, it is extremely costly to have insulation enhancements in mid/high-rise buildings. To achieve similar insulation savings to those achievable with Carbon Cut, older multi-story buildings must be clad externally or dry-lined internally at a much higher cost and considerable disruption. These systems suffer the additional disadvantages in that installing dry lining loses internal space and external cladding normally requires planning consent.

There are 5.4m cavities of easy/hard to treat (Government figures) that could benefit from the Carbon Cut system and buildings could potentially achieve a higher category of energy assessment.

This opens a new market for cavity wall insulation, which was either impossible/hard to insulate and/or was only previously serviceable by much more expensive and intrusive methods.

Access to this large market will be gained by way of advertising to the private landlord’s association by first informing, then licensing to their maintenance contractors after we have completed some fitting of trays ourselves 

The cost of trading will be £250,000 to cover – vans/tools/stock and running costs until payments start coming in. (unable to progress because of Covid19)

We have a Innovate UK Grant to cover the completion of Insertion system up £88,000.00

Moving Forward

With climate change near the top of political/scientistic problems, the major issues of CO2 and plastic waste must be tackled in an affordable way.

Emissions from buildings have be addressed in two ways, reduction of energy use, and decarbonisation of energy. The latter is being address with wind and solar, but these energy supplies cannot address the energy problem, without large reduction of usage. 

Most buildings are large wasters of energy, construction of new buildings is improving, existing buildings have a long way to go.

This area is where our affordable and sustainable Tray will reduce the consumption of energy and in turn reduce emissions. 

The normal way of new technology entering the marketplace is, starting in a small way/area and building coverage in time, expanding the company at the same pace. This cannot be the way forward for this technology, mainly because of time constraints, by way of the speed of Climate Change.

The way forward is licensing to large companies with the capability of continental roll-out.

Making this jump is challenging, being construction like to move slowly, if at all, and we will have to make a Unicorn business overnight.

Step one – Technology is ready

Step two – The IP value is sufficient to finance the expansion – Trademark being placed in about 40 territories.

Step three – making the technology known to political/construction/insulation industries.     

Step four – making customers/end-users aware of the new technology, companies like, Social Housing, Private Landlords Associations, and from them finding their maintenance companies, who would be fitting our technology – further, BRE and construction companies would have to be informed.

All the above would-be large users of our Trays

Step 5 – After creating/assessing the demand – UK – setting Manufacture, Distribution, Fitting, license contracts. 

Step 6 – Premises, this would have – Office, Workshop, Stores, also an outside storage area.

Parking, with room for vans and lorries 

Overseas 

Could be set-up the same as above or could be licensed to a multi-national construction company on each continent/worldwide.

Environmental Impact of Concrete



CO2 Emissions



After Water, Concrete is the most used materials in the world.  Concrete alone, produces 8-11% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.  In comparison global volcanic activity accounts for .5 to 1% and forest fires account for 5% of the worlds Co2 emissions annually.



Water Shortage 



Along with releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, concrete production is responsible for using vast amounts of clean, fresh water. 



Research indicates that during the next 35 years, 2,300–2,800 km3 will be withdrawn by the concrete industry. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-017-0009-5)  



For example, annual concrete production uses a volume equivalent of 26 lakes the size of Lough Neagh the largest lake in Ireland and the UK.  



World environmental experts have agreed the construction industry has a big role to play in protecting the planet. The construction industry is one of the biggest polluters of the earth, mostly due to the use of concrete. 



Sand Shortage



Sand is a finite resource which is running out quickly most people think the world is full of sand this abundant sand is formed in deserts and is formed by wind erosion which makes it very fine and spherical in shape bbc why-the-world-is-running-out-of-sand



Housing



Globally housing supply is falling well short of demand – supply in the UK alone in 2020 is one million units behind demand.

The construction labour force is declining. Highly skilled and experienced workers are retiring or have retrained into other professions.  There is a huge shortfall in apprenticeship uptake due to lack of appetite to work in the construction sector owing to its vulnerability in economic downturn.  The labour force is not sustainable, and a runaway crisis is unfolding before us.



Traditional onsite methods of construction are slow and arduous. They also predominantly use concrete which along with being very damaging to environment and time consuming brings a wide range of quality and working conditions issues.



Costs are rising month on month. Constructing houses becoming difficult for councils and impossible for low- and middle-class families. 



Background To Our Solution



Method 1 is called Onsite construction; this is the Traditionally brick by brick method that has served us well for millenniums.  It is when all the components are delivered to site and assembled piece by piece. Onsite construction is a long arduous process that brings with it substantial margins for error, delays and inconsistencies along with the addition of creating an enormous environmental impact. Due to climate change, the global housing crisis and the fact that many traditional building materials are unsustainable, this method of construction is coming near to its demise and an alternative is needed urgently.



Method 2 is called Offsite construction; this building process is when most of the building’s components are manufactured in a fine-tuned quality-controlled factory environment similar to the cars are made.  Main assemblies such as walls, floors and roofs are made in panelised or volumized sections which are then delivered to site and assembled in a fast and safer building process. Offsite site construction has many advantages over the older onsite method.  It also has a lower environmental impact due to its use of more sustainable materials and a lot less deliveries to site.  However, both methods rely heavily on environmentally damaging concrete (Please see below)  

Terratonics has developed a robust pioneering concrete free foundation and floor system, which is aimed at offsite manufacturers, it will allow them to fully detach from using concrete in Modern Methods of Construction systems (MMC’s): such as, Timber Frame, Light Gauge Steel Frame and Structural Insulated Panels (SIP’s) building systems. Terratonics will offer a sustainable alternative to these offsite manufacturers, to replace expensive and environmentally damaging concrete in foundations and sub-floors.

Herriot Watt University are using the Terratonics solution for their sustainable house of the future at the Dubai Expo which is now 2021. The company is also engaged in a UK Government project called Seismic. This is a project to standardise the building of modular schools of which 2,000 will be built per year. 



A summary of the Key Benefits of the Terratonics Solution are:





The Solution 



The main component of the Terratonics solution is a Terrapod which is a structural pedestal beam carrier that transfers the building’s associated loads to the engineered ground below. The Terrapod is made from an engineering polymer called Nyrim that is extremely tough and has both a high tensile and compression strength. Each Terrapod is set out in grid formation to suit the buildings design then they are connected to timber or lgs steel beams, leveled in place and then floor and the wall assemblies are installed. The system is very fast and it is loved by environmental conscience architects engineers and builders. 

Our system can be used in a wide variety of residential and commercial building projects, such as:

•	Housing

•	Schools

•	Office space

•	Nursing homes  

•	Additional space for public buildings such as hospitals. 

•	Tourism Recreational/amenity buildings 

•	Micro data centres

Every minute, a truckload of trash ends up in our oceans, posing a threat to humans, animals and the environment. everwave GmbH from Aachen solves this problem and is committed to closing the waste cycle.  



The company's approach is based on four pillars: detect – collect – recycle - inspire.  



Their worldwide cleanups take place with the innovative river platform HiveX and the efficient waste collection boat CollectiX. Both technologies prevent waste from entering the oceans. HiveX acts passively and can be lowered into rivers in a stationary position to collect any floating trash. CollectiX is actively responsible for the large, accumulated garbage ponds. The technologies are complemented by artificial intelligence, which analyzes trash scanned by drones and sensors to determine its exact composition. In doing so, everwave can draw on a broad network of partners and experts in the fields of science, industry, and the public. 



A research team is working to ensure that trash is recycled after collection through environmentally friendly processes. In each country of operation, efforts are made with local recycling companies to sort, wash and shred the collected material, then return it to the cycle.  



In addition, the company is supported by the everwave foundation gGmbH. This raises public awareness of the plastic challenge and develops valuable materials for environmental education in schools. Lectures also help to inspire society ecologically. 



The startup's challenge: the more rivers everwave clears of trash, the higher the costs become. everwave was therefore one of the first companies to introduce the concept of ""plastic credits."" Here, everwave collects waste from rivers on behalf of companies. Similar to the principle of C02 compensation, companies can thus compensate for a certain amount of waste. For each euro, everwave retrieves one kilogram of waste, uses artificial intelligence to evaluate it, and further develops local recycling structures. This is an opportunity not only for everwave. 



So far, everwave has already collected 260 tons of waste from rivers in 12 locations in 7 countries, such as Romania, Italy, Serbia or Cambodia, and further countries of operation are already being planned.

Artys’ disruptive solution is a Decision Support System – DSS that takes advantage of the patented  Smart Rainfall System - SRS technology for a better response to hydrogeological emergencies providing real-time rainfall monitoring and short-term forecasts of flood risk.



A network of low-cost and easy-to-install sensors takes advantage of a well-known phenomenon - the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in the case of precipitation - to get rain specific information, processing the attenuation of the satellite TV signals transmitted by commercial satellites and received by common parabolic dishes. SRS provides real-time rainfall distribution information and short-term forecast about critical hydrogeological conditions through continuatively updated and high definition maps.



Our DSS allows a time anticipation of the emergency, predicting rainfall effects based on the observation of the actual meteo-hydrologic situation instead of simulated scenarios derived from weather forecasting. The information we allow wiser and faster choices and optimal, evidence-grounded decisions for managing emergencies.

This Solution provides a chemical-free alternative to treat highly contaminated industrial waste water. The Electro Contaminant Removal (ECR) uses electricity and metal electrodes to coagulate contaminants present in waste water, allowing them to be easily removed as sludge, resulting in cleaner water being produced and returned to the environment. The treatment process is continuous and is completed within 3 minutes. The switch from chemical treatment to ECR allows factories to discharge cleaner water while generating significantly less sludge. Sludge generated by the ECR treatment process is safe for direct landfilling. Furthermore, the ECR removes multiple contaminants in a single process, eliminating the challenges and high cost incurred from using multiple chemicals.

- Saturation.

- Cost.

- Lack of visibility.

- Ecology, Health and Safety.



Vision: Daba'Go aspires to become a leading transport hub in Africa and then extend its services to the rest of the world. Its objective is to make transportation information clear and accurate to all citizens without constraint and stress on a daily basis, as well as to participate in the optimization and development of the continent's public transportation networks by collaborating with local transportation stakeholders.



Daba'Go does not aspire to address all the transport problems in Africa's major cities because some of them are beyond the understanding of a simple entrepreneurial will. Daba'Go has worked on two principles:

- Human solution: that it be available 24/7, that it be accessible and adaptable to all regardless of social origin or income level, that it be intuitive and easy to use, that it be exhaustive on multimodal coverage and that it respond to problems that affect them directly (saturation, budget, health...). 

- Solution for transport actors: a tailor-made solution for the city that takes into account its specificities and the multiplicity of its transport types (tramway, bus, train, cab, car-sharing, VTC, bicycle, car-sharing...), which takes into account the rapid evolution of the city and therefore evolves with it. Finally, we want our solution to be consistent with the country's policies and the concepts of sustainable development.



Transportation has a big inconvenience which is the pollution it causes. Transport alone is responsible for 15% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Morocco, i.e. 48 million tons of CO2 equivalent. Transport is the source of emissions of several other types of pollutants (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and lead), all of which cause health problems.

Not counting indirect and health-related costs, the degradation of air quality cost 9.7 billion dh in 2014 (1.05% of GDP).



Summary of THE IMPACT : 

- Division of greenhouse gas emissions associated with displacement by a minimum of 6 or even 7

- Increase in the contribution of pollution to gross mortality from 9% to 1.5%.

- Tracking users' CO2 emissions

- Implementation of CO2 emission as a criterion



Summary of the TRAINING EFFECT : 

The application has been developed so that the key elements are independent. This allows us to add a new city (without considering the data collection time which can be variable if data is provided or if Daba'Go has to collect it) in less than a week.



Physical environment :

More regular use of public transport in a manner appropriate to individual needs and budgets (thus affecting all social classes, although low-income people between 15 and 55 years of age are most affected).

Fewer private vehicles, thus a quieter and more pleasant city.

An urban redevelopment that is in line with the population's migratory flows and with the needs and desires of the citizens.



Daba'Go offers an application that calculates the optimal route for a given path and offers the user a selection of options considering the different means of transport available (train, taxi, tram, walk, bus…). Routes are calculated and classified according to the user's preference criteria: 

 	Cost

 	Duration

 	Maximum number of connections

 	Refusal to use certain means of transport

	In addition, through partnerships, Daba'Go aims to be exhaustive on all the possibilities of getting around within a city.

	The Daba GO application is available on any smartphone (Android and Iphone) regardless of its version and on the website. Continuous monitoring is provided to manage bugs and improve the application.

	This application is therefore intended to be a suitable solution for developing cities since it:

 	It is carried out by potential users and based on requests from local transport users.

 	It considers the specifics of the organization of transport that are found almost only in large cities of developing countries.

Only the European urban WWTPs consume a total 15,021 GWh/year.  Across Europe, water is the fourth most energy-intensive sector, with aeration of activated sludge plants contributing a staggering 2% of net electricity usage. Aeration constitutes 54% to 80% of the total energy consumed in the WWT process. Consequently, a huge amount of energy-associated CO2 is released. The present aeration processes are neither efficient, very economical, nor environment friendly. 

Solution: Cavitech ( ACT' Aeration Technology) utilizes innovative methods based on hydrodynamic supercavitation to efficiently mix gas (air containing oxygen) and liquid (treated wastewater). ACT’s unique exploitation of the developed hydrodynamic cavitation phenomena in Cavitech substantially reduces the energy spent to aerate and suspend the activated sludge in WWTP bio-reactors, and as a result, cuts energy consumption &costs, environmental impact.

Competitive advantages: Cavitech reduces energy consumption for aeration in WWTP by 60-80%, while dramatically lowering Capital and Operational costs enabling large sale margins and use of advanced business models like Energy Performance Contracting (ESCO model). We have demonstrated: x4-5 times higher O2 transfer per kWh in comparison to fine-bubble aerators (gold-standard). Also, Cavitech due to its high aeration efficiency needs to inject to water less air, thus generating fewer fumes and harmful aerosols which result from the air sparging effect.  Another Cavitech advantage: renewable energy sources like solar and wind can be used to power Cavitech.

Technology Status: TRL7: In 2021-2022 the company has been conducting full-scale industrial performance validation for Aeration Efficiency and other industrially adopted critical KPIs. 

Market size: The global Water & Wastewater treatment equipment market is predicted to be valued at $103.41 billion by 2025, rising from $50.65 billion in 2015.  The global wastewater aeration systems market will reach $8.39 billion in 2020. In total, there are over 70K WWTPs in Europe. Of this total, there about 22K municipal WWTPs.

Company strategy: CAVITECH develops technology for all types of biological WWTP plants. CAVITECH plans to take advantage of the European market as WWTP need to comply with the EC WasteWater Treatment Directive & European pressure for reductions in energy-intensive industries.

Business model and commercialization: In order to be scalable, we provide technology and follow a B2B through trained and certified distributors. In the short term, the company also foresees creating new revenue models based on energy saving following an ESCO model with financial institutions. 

Key partnerships secured: Wastewater treatment operators in Spain and Israel: ESAMUR and Canal de Isabel II ( Spain) Palgey Maim (IL) for demos in AFULA WWTP, Hasolelim WWTP, and Tnuva WWTP.  Design offices GIZMAKER, AR and ECLECTIC Suppliers: Grundfos (Denmark)  ANDRITZ AG (Austria), and Huber SE Technology (Germany). Research: CENTA (Spain) Water Utilities: EMASESA (Spain) Distributors: WTN (NL)

Funding needs: For the plans outlined in this proposal, we estimate we will need a total of approximately €1.3M until we reach the break-even point (the year 2024). We are requesting a grant of €1.1M, and expecting to raise 1M in EIC equity finance.

",Startup or self-employed,2020.0,5,innovator,Samuel,le Bihan,,,,, France,https://www.facebook.com/earthwake.officiel/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/earthwake-officiel/,,"Earthwake started off as an NGO founded in December 2014 by Samuel le Bihan and Benoit Miribel. They created Earthwake to find solutions that prevent plastic waste from reaching our oceans and to empower the populations that are weakened by this pollution. This is important because, once in the water, plastic wastes break down into microparticles invisible to the naked eye, making it almost impossible to clean. The Earthwake team were quickly joined by François Danel (ex Action against hunger director), offering the expertise he gained in his humanitarian career.



From the outset, the idea was to give value to plastic waste to incentivise its collection. With this in mind, the founding members of Earthwake quickly became very interested in the technologies of Pyrolysis and Plastic to Oil. They looked into various technologies without finding a reliable, affordable, and eco-friendly upgrading system. Earthwake's turning point was meeting Christofer Costes. He was working on the first version of a pyrolysis equipment. Christofer Costes, joined the team, and the journey to develop the first low-tech plastic pyrolyzer capable of turning plastic waste into fuel began.



In September 2018, after three years of R&D and testing, Earthwake  presented a demonstrator of a machine called Chrysalis.

 

The launch of the Chrysalis was a milestone in our development and the official demonstration that low-tech solutions can be put in place to clean up plastic waste on our planet. Given that plastic pollution damages are higher in developing countries and primarily affect countries that lack the resources to effectively tackle the issue, the use of  chrysalis  machines also aims to assist countries in the global south and remote regions by converting this waste in to a fuel.



Chrysalis is a real instrument of the circular and local economy. The main ambition of the Chrysalis is to fight plastic pollution by offering a practical solution: to turn waste into a source of energy. Our second ambition is to make plastic recycling a source of income and job creation.The latest version of our machine, the Chrysalis 40 (40 kg of plastic wastes transfomed per cycle), was presented this September on the World Clean-up day in France. This low-tech pyrolysis machine is capable of converting 160kg of plastics per day into 120L of diesel fuel. This event was the culmination of years of work and the real  start of our clean-up mission.



The device combines two technologies- the Pyrolysis and precision distillation. This integrated system makes the Chrysalis 40 significantly innovative compared to other pyrolysis systems.

Crucially, Pyrolysis is a combustion without oxygen and thus without a flame, which allows the plastic to become another material. The plastic is melted and distilled, then cooled and recovered in various states, including diesel. This enables the production of a high-quality fuel directly usable in generators, agricultural machinery, boats...



Another impressive quality of Chrysalis is its energy self-sufficiency. Indeed, the gas produced during the process is used to power the machine. Also, Chrysalis does not emit toxic smokes because the combustion takes place in an hermetic oven. 



Chrysalis has a 95% energy yield : 65% of diesel, 15% of gasoline and 15% of gas. The 5% left are a residue of black carbon that can be enhanced. 



Five main advantages can be found in Chrysalis : 

- A solution that converts plastic wastes (even those which are not recyclable) into energy. 

- A human-scale solution providing alternatives to landfilling and incineration.

- A mobile solution that can be installed easily and quickly in communities that need the most.

- A machine self-sufficient in energy that provides vulnerable populations energy through their plastic wastes

- A profitable solution

In 2020, Earthwake Entreprise was created in order to operate the scale up of our equipment : Chrysalis.

The original purpose was to produce plans.



With BIM, the digital model, 3D point clouds, requests have evolved faster than software solutions to meet them. Although digital twins, interoperability, collaborative work, data exchanges are at the heart of many debates, no software solution has hitherto provided an efficient global response.



Faced with the lack of a solution, e-CASSINI was born in March 2017, from a blank sheet, following a fundraiser in “love money” from local industrial investors totally foreign to the business sectors concerned. .



The design of e-CASSINI is based on: 

• on independence from cloud solutions, 

• the creation of a disruptive software offer compared to the current market offer, the e-CASSINI offer is 100% cloud, connectable and interoperable with any cloud and any other software. The freedom and independence of the user is thus preserved and encouraged. 

• The association of any type of geolocated data (point clouds, video, photos, orthophotos, vector plans, GIS, etc.) 

The connection and use of all available geolocated open data

• the promotion of the ""e-CASSINI Partenaires"" network, independent data producers who guarantee a renewed referral offer.



Connectivity and Interoperability are at the heart of the design of e-CASSINI.

• 100% cloud solution in Saas mode, your Database can be stored in the cloud of your choice or stored on dedicated physical servers.

• The Database is designed to be used by any PC, tablet, smartphone, chrome book ... without any particular resource in terms of memory and graphic interface.

• Connectivity and interoperability with the main GIS formats

• Connectivity and interoperability with the main CAD formats

• Connectivity and interoperability with the main formats on the market

• Connectivity and interoperability with any software whether it is ""desktop"", ""tablet"" or ""cloud""





The e-Cassini solution contributes to the development of the following three main activity sectors:



Construction 4.0

The integration of digital into traditional construction trades, the use of digital on construction sites and in delivered works represent major challenges.

Industrial challenges 

• life-cycle modeling 

• piloting 

• operation and maintenance 

• supply chain organization (factories, workshops, construction sites) 

• improvement of quality, productivity, operational efficiency

Commercial issues

• acceleration of interfaces between partners, providers and customers

• improvement of existing offers and development of new offers and new uses

• creation of digital twins to increase the digital value of services

• increased use value for end users

• improvement of quality, productivity, operational efficiency



Immobilier as a Service

Buildings, public space and associated services are therefore interoperable and connected, enriching usage data and environmental data in order to constitute digital twins carrying new services. e-CASSINI encourages the massive production of reliable, traceable data, guaranteed in terms of precision and completeness so as to share “As Built” digital twins.



e-Cassini is an interoperable platform that makes data available in shared repositories.



The digital twin is a virtual 3D representation of an environment. Modeled in 3D, your assets are stored in e-CASSINI Cloud to ensure secure sharing with your employees or providers. All data formats can be stored on this Cloud for use in immersion in ""project"" and / or maintenance phases. e-Cassini supports you in building, storing, using and updating your “As Built” repository.





Smart Infrastructure

e-CASSINI offers operational services in the implementation of Smart Infrastructures, the heart of the public service missions of local authorities and driving the competitiveness of companies that operate large networks.

Many use cases illustrate the contribution of e-CASSINI for Smart Infrastructures .



The ""e-Cassini Partners"" network is the only global response on a National Territory of everyday practitioners, anchored in the Territories, who are developing new offers and new uses at the heart of Smart Infrastructure issues.



Sharing and Mutualising georeferenced data is the vocation of e-Cassini with five main objectives:

- Save money at all levels (companies, local authorities, etc.) in collecting this type of resource

- Democratize access to this data and avoid it being held by categorical monopolies

- Democratize the exploitation of this data to free yourself from the dependence of the rare software publishers (all of global size) 

- Democratize the production of this data and prevent it from being held by global monopolies 

- Develop technical and technological solutions to ensure the updating of this data everywhere in the world.



To democratize the production, e-CASSINI is also developing an “e-CASSINI Business Partners” network to encourage independent production generating new offers and new uses based on the concepts of guarantee, certification, traceability and prior updates essential to the use IA.

The members of the “e-CASSINI Business Partners” network are everyday practitioners rooted in the regions, they illustrate the economic strength of the territories and the innovative capacity of the “short circuits”.

The first network of partners was created in France in November 2018. The objective is to develop this type of network in all countries where this is possible.



At the same time, e-Cassini created a rental service for lidar sensors to encourage this type of production of georeferenced data.



In addition to the ""e-Cassini Business Partners"" network, e-Cassini has developed the MarketPlace offer. MarketPlace allows any producer of georeferenced data to publish it to make it directly and easily accessible to any potential user.



Develop technical and technological solutions through the « e-Cassini Technological Partners ».

Since January 2019, e-Cassini has developed the “e-Cassini Technological Partners” network. Technological Partners develop innovative solutions, around the exploitation of georeferenced data, connectable to the e-Cassini application (augmented reality, virtual reality, digital photogrammetry, route analysis, automatic recognition, development of artificial intelligence, etc. …).



Since June 2020 e-Cassini has been developing the network of ""e-Cassini partner software publishers"". This network is made up of software solutions publishers (desktop and cloud) who wish to use the power of the e-Cassini solution to boost their own solutions on the cloud. e-Cassini provides them with its API tutorial which contains the description and instructions for use of all the e-Cassini APIs.

Three experiments are currently underway in France, but e-Cassini can be used worldwide.



Since July 2020 e-Cassini has been developing an OpenData module dedicated to geolocated data, making it possible to illustrate the daily interest in the pooling of this type of data.





Disruption, innovation and transition make up the fuel for e-CASSINI, and we encourage any additional innovation to plug into our solution.

This is further aggravated under low temperature, where the battery loses capacity and supplemental heating draws significant electrical energy, reducing range by up to 40%. On the other hand, excess heat produced during operation or charging is usually rejected to the environment.



The Thermal Storage Tank (TST) uses the thermal mass of the existing washer tank, carried on every vehicle, as a heat storage device. The heat generated during vehicle operation is stored on-board and released during cold re-start of the vehicle, supplementing auxiliary electric heating. It may also serve as a heat sink during thermal peaks, for example in fast charging mode. Washer tank sizes are increasing due to the additional cleaning needs for driver assistance devices.

LHPs work by creating a capillary pumping effect caused by the porous wick structure within the evaporator. The liquid vaporizes on the copper baseplate and moves around the system due to pressure differences. LHP can be used for the following applications: Power Electronics (IGBTs, MOSFETs, SiC & GaN components), processors and servers, electronics & photonics  (LEDs, Lasers, Antennas, Peltier Modules).

Every minute, a truckload of trash ends up in our oceans, posing a threat to humans, animals and the environment. everwave GmbH from Aachen solves this problem and is committed to closing the waste cycle.  



The company's approach is based on four pillars: detect – collect – recycle - inspire.  



Their worldwide cleanups take place with the innovative river platform HiveX and the efficient waste collection boat CollectiX. Both technologies prevent waste from entering the oceans. HiveX acts passively and can be lowered into rivers in a stationary position to collect any floating trash. CollectiX is actively responsible for the large, accumulated garbage ponds. The technologies are complemented by artificial intelligence, which analyzes trash scanned by drones and sensors to determine its exact composition. In doing so, everwave can draw on a broad network of partners and experts in the fields of science, industry, and the public. 



A research team is working to ensure that trash is recycled after collection through environmentally friendly processes. In each country of operation, efforts are made with local recycling companies to sort, wash and shred the collected material, then return it to the cycle.  



In addition, the company is supported by the everwave foundation gGmbH. This raises public awareness of the plastic challenge and develops valuable materials for environmental education in schools. Lectures also help to inspire society ecologically. 



The startup's challenge: the more rivers everwave clears of trash, the higher the costs become. everwave was therefore one of the first companies to introduce the concept of ""plastic credits."" Here, everwave collects waste from rivers on behalf of companies. Similar to the principle of C02 compensation, companies can thus compensate for a certain amount of waste. For each euro, everwave retrieves one kilogram of waste, uses artificial intelligence to evaluate it, and further develops local recycling structures. This is an opportunity not only for everwave. 



So far, everwave has already collected 260 tons of waste from rivers in 12 locations in 7 countries, such as Romania, Italy, Serbia or Cambodia, and further countries of operation are already being planned. The goal: to initiate a holistic change.

The world's first installed parking meter was in Oklahoma City on July 16, 1935. Magee received a patent for the apparatus on 24 May 1938.

The main attribute of the parking meter was the ability to control any size of vehicle and to charge rent for the space used thereby increasing city revenues.

Fast forward to 2019 private bicycle and scooter, public share bicycles and scooters of all types are now creating chaotic street clutter demand from many different quarters now need their own space requirements putting enormous pressures on streetspace

They all need space that is risk assessed ,for public safety insurance cover, without this standard being authorised there is no public liability insurance cover.

For example Barcelona has Bicing, a very large expensive dock based system, that is very popular, it also has private bike hoops taking up more space, other bike share operators like donkey bikes uses these hoops, reducing private bike capacity, then there are scooter bikes appearing, some like Lime scooters, are trusting users to park safely anywhere which affects public liability insurance cover .

Who is responsible for a pedestrian tripping up and being injured.

Smart Lock and Dock solves all these issues, like the original parking meter, any type of car van or lorry becomes parking space that is controllable,

Smart Lock and Dock does the same, for any type of two wheeled vehicle, electric or pedal, can now be controlled in the same controlled securely and safely from a single unit.

The inefficiency of needing to rebalance dock based bike share, every night, using specially designed trucks is eliminated

Instead of 80% of docks being occupied with bikes waiting to be used and 20%of Docks waiting for a bike to be parked.

Smart Lock and Dock has 80% of parking space waiting for a bike to be parked allowing a free floating type use for Bicing

The Smart Lock and Dock has no infrastructure requirements and can, with operational experience, improve efficiency, by moving to better more efficient locations.

The cost of the Smart Lock and Dock is 90% cheaper than the Bicing and has a ROI of 6 months",,"SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities",1.0

As a result, surplus electricity is generated in windy and sunny periods, which to an increasing share cannot be fed into the grid. On the other hand, the deconstruction of conventional power plants causes supply gaps in times of low wind and sun. Therefore the development and installation of innovative long term storage technologies is one of the main challenges in the transformation of the energy system. In order to tackle this challenge, MicrobEnergy has developed its own system of power-to-gas technology. With this process, electricity can be converted into hydrogen by electrolysis. This hydrogen can either be used directly or, in a second step, converted together with carbon dioxide from a biogas or sewage plant into methane gas. Chemically identical to natural gas, methane can be fed into the natural gas grid in unlimited quantities. In this way the existing infrastructure of the natural gas network can be used as a huge energy storage and transport system.

Geothermal energy is heat that comes from the sub-surface of the Earth. To produce it, wells are drilled deep into underground reservoirs. Hot water is brought to the surface for direct use of the heat (for district heating) or to generate electricity. All you need to do is to reach the correct thermal temperatures cost-efficiently, which is today the prohibitive factor. PLASMABIT® can keep drilling fast and costs linear, unlike conventional methods. The exploitation of ultra-deep geothermal energy around 10km deep will unlock unlimited power, and also be very financially attractive.

Water quality in fish farming systems rapidly deteriorates as fishes consume O2 and discharge CO2 as part of their respiration. Uneaten food and feces accumulate creating an unhealthy environment. This is further compounded by the spread of undesirable microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and viruses in the rearing system. To tackles these challenges, Searen developed  Vacuum AirLift™ or VAL™,  a simple multi-functional device that performs essential functions reliably and efficiently.  The VAL™ is an enabling technology that makes recirculating aquaculture systems profitable and environmentally sustainable. Recirculating aquaculture systems produce high-quality protein and nutritious food in a controlled environment. High quality product requires precision control of the water condition. The VAL™ is a smart technology that provides water circulation, carbon dioxide and other undesirable gas stripping, oxygenation and particulate removal in a single simple device. The VAL™ uses a vacuum pump to power a microbubble airlift pump. The airlift pump provides low head water circulation. The microbubbles provide gas exchange allowing undesirable gases to be extracted by the vacuum. The microbubbles also attract fine particulates creating foam that is removed by the vacuum. Oxygen injected in the outgoing flow replenishes the dissolved oxygen level.","February 8, 2021",Searen,United States,Small scale commercialization,"Funding, Partners, Credibility",BusinessFarming & AgricultureAquaculture & Fish,"Aquaculture, Aquaculture effluents, Industrial wastewater, Filtration & purification, Water & Wastewater treatment","Food/Agri, Water, Waste/Pollution, Wastewater management",,"VAL™ reduces energy consumption up to one eighth the level required for competing equipment;VAL™ has been demonstrated to reduce pathogen loads by 99.9% in 12 hours, decreasing notably E. coli concentration from 16750 u/ml to 27 u/ml;In independent testing against other foam fractionators, the VAL™ was 45% more effective in reducing Total Suspended Solids (TSS) using 66% less energy than competing equipment;Due to its high energy efficiency VAL™ has a greater than 85% reduction in CO2 emissions ;As part of a photo bioreactor based waste processor, VAL™ removed 96% of total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organics - Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was reduced from 210 to 7.8 mg/l;VAL™ does not produce any hazardous waste by products - it uses a purely physical process requiring no chemical additives providing a 100% reduction in consumables;","The energy cost to operate VAL™ is as low as 15% of competing solutions;In a US fish hatchery, VAL™ provided  a rate increase of 2.6 to 5.3 times depending on species;In a US fish hatchery, VAL™ provides a fast ROI and significant payback by reducing acquisition costs by 38% and operating cost by approximately 50% ;","Europe,Asia,Africa,North america,Australia","France,Denmark,Switzerland,Norway,Hungary,Spain,Belgium,Saudi Arabia,Madagascar,Morocco,Tunisia,Chad,Algeria,United States,Canada,New Zealand,New Caledonia,Australia","REM: A novel acid regeneration system for steel pickling (Waste & Pollution,Water,Industry & Consumer Goods);E.S.T.: An intelligent robot-based system for automatic extraction, treatment and packaging of sediments (Waste & Pollution);ECOSOFTT: A suite of solutions to allow underserved communities to manage their water resources (Buildings & Shelters,Waste & Pollution,Water);BIO DISPERSIS LC: Recycle vinasse, a polluting residue from the alcohol industry, into organic additives for concrete (Waste & Pollution,Industry & Consumer Goods);",https://solarimpulse.com/companies/searen,Searen,634_C,Searen's VAL™ provides an elegant multi-functional solution to water treatment that reduces CAPEX and OPEX by 20 to 80%,Startup or self-employed,2013.0,3,innovator,Emmanuel,Briquet and John Brooks,,,,,"Cincinnati, OH 45209, USA",https://www.facebook.com/SearenLLC,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/searen-llc,634_P,"Searen’s solution provides water circulation, particulate removal and aeration with a single simple device resulting in water treatment systems that are less complex and more efficient.

The inherent simplicity of the design produces a number of unique benefits.  The open, free flow design makes it high volume, non-clogging, low energy input and requires no or limited consumables.  The simplicity and multi functionality leads to high reliability and scalability.  The VAL is a high impact, platform technology that supports sustainable water treatment processes.  

Our beachhead market is aquaculture (fish farming).  The need for healthy, low cost protein sources has made aquaculture a high growth market in the US.  Land based Sustainable Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (SRAS) are the fastest growing aquaculture segment.  The VAL™ is an ideal candidate for these systems due to its ability to circulate the water, remove fine particulates, strip carbon dioxide and inject oxygen with high energy efficiency.  The particulates removed by the VAL include viruses, bacteria, toxic algae and off flavor compounds thereby increasing fish biomass yield and quality.  After establishing our beachhead market, we will expand into other industrial and municipal markets such as agriculture wastewater treatment, food and beverage industry, Harmful Algae Bloom (HAB) remediation, Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) site remediation, municipal wastewater treatment, oil and gas clean-up, algaculture as well as other opportunities.

This Energy & C02-e Saving Technology can help to supply pure water to where there is need (e.g. to rural, regional and remote communities where access to clean water is unavailable, or unreliable and to townships, farmers, industry, municipalities, environmental rehabilitation projects, mining/mine remediation projects, etc.).  CSMED technology can be utilised to provide clean/supplemental water supplies for larger towns and cities.   Demand for, and pressure on, precious fresh water resources can thus be reduced.  The CSMED technology can clean, purify/distil water from a range of otherwise unusable water sources, including agriculture and industry wastewater, contaminated water (including mine tailings dams). brackish bore and saline/hyper-saline water, seawater. recycled water, mining and sewage sludge.  Depending on water/wastewater/sludge and irradiance availability, each modular CSMED unit can produce around 30,000 litres of pure water per day.  Units can be integrated into larger processing systems, or into large multi-unit fields, where large and very large volumes of wastewater, contaminated water or sludge needs to be processed.  For example, a major project in the Tulare Basin in California plans installation of up to 2500 integrated units in the first of several fields to process agriculture wastewater (17,000ppm to 12ppm) to produce an estimated 28GL pure water per annum.  Some harvesting of salts is also proposed.  The Dewatering units can be added at the end of a line of Distillation units, or to the back end of existing reverse osmosis systems (at the point where reverse osmosis membranes are unable to process) to further extract pure water and take heavy brine concentrate or sludge back to zero liquid discharge (ZLD), or various percentages of moisture content, as required.  This enables reduction of volumes of waste/toxic waste brine concentrate or sludge residue which requires handling, transport and safe storage/environmentally sustainable disposal, along with reductions in costs associated with handling, transport and safe storage/disposal.   Distillation and Dewatering can also be utilised for biosolids management.  Producing clean water from recycled and otherwise unusable water sources reduces demand for volumes of fresh water, along with reducing transport footprints and costs.  Fresh water resources can be preserved.  Remineralisation at end of processing is determined by end use.  Green Hydrogen Energy Production could utilise this technology as electrolysis requires availability of distilled water.  This Solar Thermal Water Purification/Distillation technology could provide distilled water, for example, by purifying contaminated, brackish/saline, recycled industry wastewater or municipal effluent, on-site, thereby reducing demand for fresh water and hydrogen transport footprints, constraints and costs.  For example, one unit can produce enough distillate to produce in excess of 3,500 kgs of Green Hydrogen per day.  Manufacture of the parabolic troughs can utilise available e-waste; the troughs are 100% recyclable.  The CSMED units were designed to be containerised for easy transport and to be able to operate off grid and in remote locations. (Alternative energy sources can be used where overnight/24 hour processing is required.)  There are no membranes.  Operation and maintenance do not require high skills sets.  The units have been assessed to withstand sustained high winds (to force 3 hurricanes in the US).   Recycling and utilising otherwise unusable water/wastewater/effluents to provide clean, safe water to local communities can help to facilitate better health outcomes, local food production,  development of local business and industry/local economies, drought resilience and future water security, whilst also  reducing demand on precious and possibly limited freshwater resources and enabling improved custodianship of natural habitats and local natural water sources.

Claude Picard organised the matching between the need of soil for the creation of the park extension and excavated soil coming from construction works in Paris.

As construction companies were paying for the evacuation of their excavated soil this also became a source of financing for the George Valbon park. ECT’s business model was born!

The main basis of this invention is the creation of a specific active material to develop for this particular application an aberrant root mass which is twenty times greater than the root mass of traditional plants.

Very quickly, it was obvious that the root mass multiplier active ingredient developed by Philippe OUAKI DI GIORNO was more important than the application for the invention of Plantoids. This is why Philippe OUAKI DI GIORNO has worked for almost a year of research to reduce the increase in root mass, no longer to twenty times but to five times greater than a traditional root mass, this is very important to be able to make this active ingredient usable in agriculture.

Since that time, he has continuously improved his invention and implemented it on all types of plants, soils and climates in order to optimize its efficiency and effectiveness.

Besides producing electric energy, heat and organic fertilizer, a part of the biogas can be refined to 98% biomethane as a fuel with the promise: 50% less fuel costs than diesel, 100% less GHG emissions. “CH4pa”, a multifunctional transport and working vehicle and “Mobi”, the Mobile Biogas Upgrading, are 2 global market innovations, specially developed to introduce BioCNG for gas driven vehicles in inland regions where no Natural Gas is available. Ch4pa is especially interesting for the 430 million farmers worldwide, that produce 75% of the global food supply and spend half of their income on diesel and fossil fertilizer. Mobi as a core component offers on-site ""biogas upgrading - AS A SERVICE”, as only few biogas plants are equipped with upgrading facilities (1-4% depending on the region). By using Mobi also small and medium scale biogas plants can benefit from producing BioCNG for their own fuel usage and by sharing the costs for upgrading technology. In those decentralized biomethane regions diesel vehicles will be substituted by CNG vehicles like CH4pa and other new gas vehicles from Scania, New Holland and others. Atmove technology helps those remote areas to develop a market for CNG vehicles at all, as there are no gas grids available. We showcased the BioCNG system with CH4pa successfully in cooperation with Itaipu/Brazil, the biggest hydropower plant in the world. Global OEMs like Scania and New Holland are starting to adopt the business model of BioCNG mobility as they also see the potential to market their CNG vehicles in remote areas. Target regions for Atmove should fulfil following criteria: strong agricultural sector (especially livestock farming), popularity of CNG, price sensitive customers, poor infrastructure (gas pipelines, electricity supply), logistical challenges (transport of goods mainly by trucks), and a strong dependency on oil imports.

A Shower tray with a heat recovery device that reduces shower water heating bills by up to 40%, improves energy efficiency, and cuts carbon footprints. It is a passive energy-saving element with a static heat recovery unit, without moving elements, it does not need maintenance and it has the same useful life as the building. Quite simply, it is a system or technology that uses the heat from the waste hot water in the shower to increase the temperature of the incoming cold water.



HOW DOES IT WORK?

When we take a shower we are throwing away the energy we have used to heat the water down the drain. During the process, the hot water used flows directly down the sewerage system and much energy is wasted. It doesn't make sense to waste all that energy and reheat cold water to use it again for just a few seconds. This is the challenge that Cerian steam tried to overcome with their technology. It is possible to recover and reuse that energy that we have already paid for to heat the water again without having to consume more energy and money. Cerian shower EcoTray is a wastewater heat recovery (WWHR) system that can effectively recapture and reuse instantly a high percentage of the energy lost into the drain, reducing energy consumption in a cost-effective manner. It is a simple system, with no moving parts, no storage, no control system, and requires no electricity to operate. A specifically engineered heat exchanger transfers heat energy from the waste hot shower water to the incoming freshwater supply, warming it from around 10 up to 30°C. When the cold water arrives at the mixing valve, it is much warmer, and therefore substantially less hot water is required from the water heater or solar array. 



WHERE TO INSTALL?

It can be installed in newly built homes and in bathroom renovations and bathtub-shower changes.

Due to its flat design, it is installed as a conventional shower tray, without making holes in the floor, facilitating the use of the shower for people with reduced mobility.

They are inexpensive to manufacture, very stable, durable, light and weatherproof. Because of these characteristics, they are used in numerous industries (automotive, wind turbines and boat industry).



Due to the excellent properties of glass fiber reinforced plastics, their production has been increasing continuously for several years. In 2019, more than 1.141 million tons of this material were produced across Europe, with an annual growth of 2% forecast for the coming years. At the same time, the amount of GRP components that reach their EOL and have to be disposed of is increasing as well. Already today, more than 200,000 tonnes of GRP waste per year have to be disposed of in Europe, although the quantities will increase significantly in the future.



Because this topic was hardly given any importance in the past, there is currently a disposal problem that threatens to worsen. Today GRP waste is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. Sustainable GRP recycling is therefore urgently needed. To date, however, no recycling method in the sense of circular economy has established itself on the market.

When the state of water is changed, for instance when the water is heated, it is less able to hold on to the minerals dissolved in it and they precipitate out to form a hard mass on the surfaces of pipes and equipment, most commonly calcium carbonate or limescale, but also phosphate or sulphate scales. This blocks and damages equipment, requiring its premature disposal. The layer of scale also forms a thermal barrier, meaning that heat transfer is greatly reduced and leading to major inefficiencies - just 2mm of scale can lead to an efficiency loss of 20%.

The Elonroad ERS works for all electric vehicles, cars, taxis, buses and trucks.

It will make it possible for Long Haul Trucks to drive electric without the need of large and heavy batteries. Without ERS an electric truck would need approximately 6 tons of batteries to drive for 8 hours (a workday). With the possibility to charge while driving the battery need is reduced by 80%. Instead of having 6 tons of batteries, an BEV Truck can have only 1 ton of batteries in order to drive from the ERS to destinations 50km away. Such battery can also be used for driving in between electric roads. For example and as a consequence, a highway would then only need to be 50% electrification because the charging on the road gives the double power than needed for the truck so it can drive twice as long as the length of the electric road.  This reduces the investment cost of charging infrastructure.

eevie is an employee engagement tool designed to foster a climate-friendly work culture in large-scale enterprises worldwide.



eevie empowers enterprises to plan & run highly configurable sustainability programs suited to their individual requirements, to reward employees for their participation with nature-based CO2 compensations, and to measure the impact of the programs to maximise employees’ emission reduction efforts.



In order to support behaviour change for the employees, we have developed a climate guide app called eevie that allows the employees to measure, track, reduce and offset their carbon footprint. eevie helps users make small changes on a daily basis by nudging them with actionable information in the right moments, by providing immediate feedback on how conscious decisions affect their day-to-day carbon footprint and by enabling them to offset their unavoidable emissions by planting trees that offset their remaining carbon footprint.



Every day that an employee engages with the eevie App, they receive 1 tree as a reward from the ""Impact Partners"". They can plant their trees in the App to offset their unavoidable carbon emissions. Each tree grows to sequester on average 12,5kg CO₂ per annum for 25 years.

Phenix is a Tech For Good startup that implements solutions to ensure that no product goes to waste. For Phenix, each unsold item should be given a second chance. If we know how to put it in the right hands, nothing should be lost!





What?

As the saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. When we throw something away, it is because we no longer use it, not necessarily because the product has no value. Based on this principle, Phenix connects those who have excess with those who do not have enough.



Phenix offers 4 alternatives to the trash can: 



- The Phenix mobile app, which allows customers to buy unsold items from shops at a reduced price 

- Donations to food banks and other nonprofits, allowing us to avoid food waste while benefiting individuals in need

- Donations that repurpose food waste into animal feed, making good use of unsold goods and leftovers not suitable for human consumption

- Compost and anaerobic digestion to process organic waste



Thanks to these solutions, Phenix is the leading startup in the fight against food waste in Europe, with more than 120,000 meals saved everyday leveraging its network of professionals and committed customers





How? 

Phenix develops innovative technology to facilitate the transfer of unsold items: 

 

- The platform places a focus on donations, using just-in-time and wholesale principles to ensure that unsold products can be used to benefit food banks and other food-related organizations.   



- The application addresses individuals committed to fighting waste, allowing them to geolocate and book unsold products at a reduced price. 



Phenix is also a pioneer in the social enterprise space, showing that economic development and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand in a new and innovative business model. Phenix is part of the Tech For Good movement and leads by example in putting the social and environmental impact of the company at the heart of its technological innovation, all of this without jeopardising economic growth. In that respect, Phenix is proud to be recognized as both a B-Corporation and an ESUS (Entreprise Solidaire d'Utilité Sociale).







Why?

One third of what we produce is produced... for nothing.

In other words, one third of the energy and resources expended to produce, transport and distribute our food goes to waste!



Waste has huge environmental, social and economic consequences:



- Environmental: If food waste were a country, it would be the 3rd largest greenhouse gases emitter. In fact, food production is now the main source of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As a result, every time food is thrown away, it results in unnecessary and preventable CO2 emissions, undermining efforts to combat global warming.

- Social: The food thrown away in France alone could feed 10 million people. This is more than the number of people in need in France, which stands at 8.8 million people. Efficient allocation can effectively address our problem of hunger.  

- Economic: Waste costs more each year than the social security deficit. The ADEME (The French Environment and Energy Management Agency) estimates that food waste costs 16 billion euros each year.

What we do:

•	KP offers an upstream solution to the sustainability challenges of polymer-based packaging by changing the performance of the polymer during the injection process. It allows to use less virgin material and a better uptake of recycled material when manufacturing PET bottles.

•	This is achieved through a technology retrofitted in existing injection machinery, hence low cost and scalability as there is no need to develop a new industrial footprint.

",Startup or self-employed,2015.0,4,innovator,Johan,Robbrecht,,,,,1922 Luxembourg,,https://twitter.com/@TanguiVdE,https://www.linkedin.com/company/28957724/admin/,,"Many innovations that address waste issues and recyclability of packaging come with trade-offs in terms of cost, Co2 emissions, energy footprint and scalability.  From the inception Keiryo realized that in order to achieve a systemic impact an innovation needed to address these trade-offs. 

Hence, it has to fulfill a number of criteria in terms of sustainability:

o	Achieve reduced use of material without complexifying recycling streams

o	Enable better recyclability without increasing CO2 Emissions

and in terms of cost:

o	Create new industry margins and/or reallocate industry margins

o	Enable global roll out based on low capital requirement for technology conversion

o	Having a strong IP basis and proprietary know-how that can be shared in a non-competitive way with all stakeholders of the supply chain.



On this basis Keiryo Packaging Technologies looked for scientific pathways to extract more value from the base material. 

To achieve this Keiryo based itself on the well-grounded polymer rheology science of Flow Enhanced Nucleation and Induced Crystallization. According to this science any semi-crystallizable polymer can alter its crystallization and morphological structure when subjected to deformational flows. This phenomenon is what enables fibre spinning. Keiryo Packaging Technologies developed a mechanism to apply it to the Injection Stretch Blow Moulding (ISBM) process of PET Bottles. 



How is this achieved?

A 3D printed metal insert is retrofitted to existing industrial hot runner nozzle housing. (see attached ppt for visual rendition). The insert is designed to generate the required activation energy into the polymer during the injection process. This triggers flow enhanced morphological changes leading to an improvement of the overall material performance (Reduced weight per bottle – higher recycled content).   



Scalability is enabled by the technology and the IP position

The Keiryo Packaging Technology materializes itself in a (670mm/2.5inches) large metal insert which   can be retrofitted in existing ISBM machinery globally. As it is manufactured through a 3D printing process it can be produced in a decentralised way.  

Intellectual Property: The KP technology has 3 patent families covering a large geographical landscape (incl. EU & US). IP has a broad scope across method and product claims. This broad IP enables to share the KP technology in a non-compete way with all stakeholders of the supply chain. Hence, enabling a large roll out of the technology.

To comply with these rules, oily waste producers most often have to pay to have their waste collected and/or treated. It unfortunately still leads to illegal dumping and discharge at sea or in rivers. Buying back these oily wastes is an incentive for producers to get them collected and treated, and helps the collectors to be sustainable.

By means of an ingenious heat exchanger module, the heat energy of the used shower water is reused to warm the incoming cold water mains. Thanks to this technology, the cold water arrives at the mixing valve up to 20°C warmer than before (from 10°C up to 30°C). Therefore, substantially less hot water is needed. By this simple means, a 4-person household can save about 1900 kWh per year. Joulia-Twinline is particularly performant in places where many people shower, such as sport centres, gyms, hotels or clinics. A single Joulia- Twinline can generate about as much heat energy as a 15m2 photovoltaic array would produce in one year (1'900 kWh/a). Showering with a clear conscience is thus both ecological and delightful. The sophisticated technology is concealed under a simple stainless steel cover. Because the heat exchanger cover also serves as a trap, the total installation height is comparable to conventional shower drains and can also be used in renovations. The technology is practically instant and cleaning is simple thanks to the easily-removable cover.","December 16, 2020",Joulia SA,Switzerland,Small scale commercialization,"Network, New clients, Visibility, Partners, Credibility","Individual, BusinessManufacturingHome Appliances, BusinessServicesBuildings Operators","Shower, Building heating","Buildings, Water, Heating, cooling and ventilation, Energy and fuel efficiency",https://player.vimeo.com/video/152669632?color=bbcb18&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0,"The drain doesn't emit any CO2 in the atmosphere, doesn't use any electric energy, just works by water flow;Save as much energy as 15 m2 of solar panels would have produced, whilst showering;Joulia-Twinline wins up to 60% of the normally lost energy back;Joulia-Twinline can be recycled by almost 100%;No impact on health;",Joulia-Twinline saves up to 60% of thermal energy with each warm shower;A 4-person household can recover arround 1'900 kWh per year;,"Europe,Asia","Netherlands,Italy,United Kingdom,Faroe Islands,Germany,Lithuania,France,Belgium,Austria,Denmark,South Korea,Japan","Solar space heating: Solar-powered air heaters and rock bed thermal storage to heat homes

There are two reasons for this waste of money :

- The unreliability of the plans

- Networks are not visible



At Syslor, we have invented two solutions that solve both problems:



For the visualization of buried networks, for instance, from Enedis pipes plans, we have modeled 8 * 8 km of buried pipes in Augmented Reality, put them in the cloud, so that they can now visualized in Augmented Reality on a smartphone with a centimeter accuracy.



When Enedis wants to modify a new pipe, they simply take a video of the new pipe, send it to us and we make an as-built 3D plan and a digital twin of the pipe and its location, then we update the Augmented Reality model in the cloud and in the client's Geographic Information System.

It is designed for a family of less than ten users per day.  The Zerho is fit-for-purpose in Rural, Peri-Urban, Construction and Emergency applications.



The Zerho Toilet has several elements that sets it aside from other products on the market.  These include:  

•	The Zerho waterless toilet is a small-dimension (160cm diameter x 90cm), off-grid toilet system which enables fast installation and relocation when necessary – saving on time, infrastructure and labour costs.

•	The Zerho waterless toilet system uses no water, additives or chemicals.  With a Urine Diversion toilet pan, there is no faecal sludge.

•	The Zerho waterless toilet system is robust and user-friendly and  has a potential lifespan of  more than 20 years.

•	Very little maintenance on the unit itself is needed due to the robust design. 

•	Odours and moisture are disposed of by effective air circulation  and solar heat onto the unit;  drawing fresh air from the indoor toilet seat section and effectively disposing of odours and moisture via the vent pipe.



The Zerho Toilet has not been tested outside of South Africa - therefore not tested in freezing temperatures.  However, no additives or special steps would be used here either.  Ambient temperatures will always impact the desiccation time;  and the (non-sludge) solid waste is always safely contained. This makes for easy removal and transport when necessary.



The Zerho Implementation Plan incorporates the support of the following Sustainable Development Goals in project communities:



SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation - Mitigating further contamination of underground water sources by traditional pit latrines and open defecation.  The Zerho Toilet offers heightened personal hygiene in a home.



SDG 9 - Industry - Local assembly of the Zerho in the project community; and development of related business activities.



SDG 11 - Sustainability in the Community - Using the Cooperative Principles for development, governance and long-term planning.



SDG 12 - Production & Consumption - Food Security; Agriculture using humanure in soil regeneration.

It has also raised concerns about the warming of the greenhouse effect and the alteration of the global nitrogen cycle, and thus of primary production and vegetation diversity. The use of chemical fertilisers is always a necessity, however, for the chemical form that these fertilisers have, they are also biocidal agents, killing certain elements in the soil, such as micro-organisms, which could transform them into elements immediately absorbable by crops. The destruction of these beneficial micro-organisms also creates the conditions for pathogens to develop in the soil, thus increasing the need for polluting plant protection products. All this has a direct impact on productivity and quality, as the entire crop food chain can be affected. Bioma has developed new, completely natural solutions, to be used once a year at the beginning of the agricultural season, which allow the soil microbiology to develop rapidly, within a few weeks, and immediately transform and provide nutritional elements to the crops. The solutions have been shown in several studies to reduce chemical fertilizers by at least 50% while increasing the quality and quantity of production.

Pneumatic material is an excellent insulator, withstands all inclement weather and, since it cannot be degraded, its final common disposal solutions are to bury it, to incinerate it or to throw it into different ecosystems. The Solution EcoTiles offers the possibility of reusing these resources, transforming them into rubber tiles.

In this way, it is possible to achieve a sustainable action with positive multi-impacts for the communities carrying it out: no public space is used with containers full of wheels, which later becomes a highly toxic waste if they are incinerated, buried, or thrown it away to the sea or in abandoned properties, with the risk of contamination and insect pests that this entails.

Several years ago, geologists from our Team predicted and then discovered a new, previously unknown natural phenomenon: many places on the Earth’s crust seep significant quantities of hydrogen gas (H2). 

The presence of naturally occurring H2 was not recognized before because it is odorless, invisible, tasteless, non-toxic, and most importantly, a very diffusive gas. Natural (geologic) hydrogen is non-fossil resource, meaning its use will not generate any pollution. It can reduce the carbon and pollution footprint of the transportation and chemical industry: hydrogen is the most energy-rich gas and is now considered to be a viable replacement for fossil fuels. Currently, the most common processes used for hydrogen generation require the decomposition of natural gas or electrolysis of water. Such methods produce undesirable by-products and require considerable expense. Therefore, there is a real need for an inexpensive, clean, and sustainable hydrogen source.

Moreover, helium in commercial concentrations is often associated with hydrogen. It is a valuable, but very scarce resource and its reserves are limited. Demand is growing faster than current supply.



To explore for this new natural resource, Natural Hydrogen Energy LLC, was formed in the United States. Members of our international Team are geologists and chemists. All Team members are highly qualified, have advanced scientific degrees, and have spent many years in hydrogen research. We have extensive knowledge of natural hydrogen and lots of ""know-how"". Combined, the Team has more than eighty-years of experience and are constantly expanding our knowledge in ongoing research collaborations with leading institutions and organizations. To assure competence in our exploration, we use the services of experts in drilling and gas production, who share our high regard for environmental protection.



After several years of intensive research, our Team selected and obtained mineral leases over our most promising geological sites. The first drilling in the USA was successfully completed by our company in 2019.

At SOP, we believe the only way to achieve this goal is through Sustainable Intensive Agriculture.

Founded in 2001 by Marco Poggianella, the Italian company SOP - Save Our Planet places both environmental protection and farmer economics at the center of all its activities. Thanks to the proprietary technology developed by SOP’s founder, the company has developed farmer oriented solutions that could enable faster climate policies.



Its products for crop systems and livestock operations interact with the microbial and biological activity of soils, plants, and animals and enable stable and consistent yields while reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.

SOP solutions include products:

• for CROPS, which help farmers reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, lowering inputs costs and mitigating the environmental impact of intensive cultivation of staple crops, including corn, wheat, soy, rice, alfalfa, and cover crops;

• for ANIMALS, which enhance overall health, improve feed conversion efficiency, and reduces costs of operations, while improving the production of milk, meat, and eggs;

• for WASTE MANAGEMENT, which reduce odors, ammonia emissions, and greenhouse gases, while mitigating the impact livestock waste on the environment and the surrounding communities.

The efficacy of the products has been established through scientific studies conducted by several of universities, including UC Davis, Cornell, University of Milan, Guelph, and the University of Piacenza.

SOP LAGOON, the product for manure lagoon management, was studied for its ability to reduce ammonia and GHG emissions from dairy liquid manure. The results of this study were published in September 2019 in the international peer reviewed journal called “Sustainability.”

SOP products are currently distributed in North America and Europe, enabling farmers to achieve sustainability within intensive agriculture across economic, environmental and social impacts.",http://sopgroup.com,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",2.0

However, all electrical appliances are built to work between 210 and 250V, so if 210-215V are enough, why use and pay more?

VoltControl devices are placed at the entrance of the electricity in the building, lowering and stabilizing tension around 210-215V. The unused power is not paid by the client, generating 8-15% of savings on the annual electricity bill.

Another huge benefit of tension lowering and stabilization is to avoid power peaks that are overheating and potentially damaging lamp bulbs and electrical engines & devices, thus lowering their life span.

Lower electricity consumption and longer lifespan of bulbs and electrical engines will not only save a lot of money for the client, but also reduce CO2 production.",http://voltcontrol.ch,"SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

The need for the switch-disconnector is to be energy efficient and able to achieve the 1500Vdc disconnecting as low amount of poles as possible, which has an impact on the efficiency level as well as lowering the needed cabeling. OTDC switch-disconnectors range above 250A ensure reliable breaking power for every current level, enhancing safety, efficiency and simplicity. For 1500V DC systems, the basic configuration is two poles from 315A up to 800A (IEC 60947) and from 250A up to 600A (UL98B). The ratings from 800A up to 1000A for 1500V are achieved by the parallel connected poles. Both front and side operated models are available. Modularity of the OTDC Switch-disconnector allows to disconnect up to 3 1500Vdc circuits with only one switch. Optimized 2-pole DC switch-disconnectors for 1500V DC utility-scale photovoltaic power plants and for Energy Storage System (ESS) applications bring space savings efficiency with up to 64% reduced power losses compared to weakest in the market and better performance with DC-PV2 ratings.","November 18, 2020",ABB,Switzerland,Medium and large scale commercialization,"New clients, Visibility","BusinessManufacturingSolar Panels, BusinessEnergy Utility","Electrical grid, Inverter, Maintenance and inspection, Solar photovoltaic","Energy, Power and fuel distribution",https://youtu.be/rJCeqeSYDfQ,"Reduce power losses up to 64% ;High performance up to DC-PV2 and DC-22B utilization categories;Up to 64% reduction of CO2 emissions annually per switch;The raw material reduction by using only 2-pole design instead of 3-pole for 1500Vdc has reduced per switch copper 43%, steel 42% and plastic 53%;The use of copper raw material reduced, because no additional connection bars are needed;",Design life of the product 30 years;Due to reduced power losses the annual saving is 44 USD per switch;,"Europe,Asia,Africa,North america,South america,Australia","Gibraltar,Guernsey,United Kingdom,Scotland,Kosovo,Vatican City,Ukraine,San Marino,Slovakia,Svalbard and Jan Mayen,Slovenia,Sweden,Russia,Serbia,Romania,Portugal,Poland,Norway,Netherlands,Malta,Republic of Macedonia,Montenegro,Republic of Moldova,Monaco,Latvia,Luxembourg,Lithuania,Liechtenstein,Jersey,Italy,Iceland,Isle of Man,Ireland,Hungary,Croatia,Greece,France,Faroe Islands,Finland,Spain,Estonia,Denmark,Germany,Czechia,Switzerland,Belarus,Bulgaria,Belgium,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Åland,Austria,Albania,Andorra,Georgia,Yemen,Vietnam,Uzbekistan,Taiwan,Turkey,Turkmenistan,East Timor,Tajikistan,Thailand,Syria,Singapore,Saudi Arabia,Qatar,State of Palestine,Pakistan,Philippines,Oman,Nepal,Malaysia,Maldives,Macao SAR,Mongolia,Myanmar [Burma],Sri Lanka,Lebanon,Laos,Kazakhstan,Kuwait,South Korea,North Korea,Cambodia,Kyrgyzstan,Japan,Jordan,Iran,Iraq,India,Israel,Indonesia,Hong Kong SAR,Cyprus,China (Mainland),Bhutan,Brunei Darussalam,Bahrain,Bangladesh,Azerbaijan,Armenia,Afghanistan,United Arab Emirates,Guinea,Gambia,Ghana,Gabon,Zimbabwe,Zambia,South Africa,Mayotte,Uganda,Tanzania,Tunisia,Togo,French Southern Territories,Chad,Swaziland,Ṣo Tom̩ and Pr?_ncipe,South Sudan,Somalia,Senegal,Sierra Leone,Saint Helena,Sudan,Seychelles,Rwanda,R̩union,Nigeria,Niger,Namibia,Mozambique,Malawi,Mauritius,Mauritania,Mali,Madagascar,Morocco,Libya,Lesotho,Liberia,Comoros,Kenya,British Indian Ocean Territory,Guinea-Bissau,Equatorial Guinea,Ethiopia,Eritrea,Western Sahara,Egypt,Algeria,Djibouti,Cape Verde,Cameroon,Ivory Coast,Republic of the Congo,Central African Republic,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Botswana,Benin,Burundi,Burkina Faso,Angola,Greenland,Grenada,U.S. Virgin Islands,British Virgin Islands,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,United States,Trinidad and Tobago,Turks and Caicos Islands,Sint Maarten,El Salvador,Puerto Rico,Saint Pierre and Miquelon,Panama,Nicaragua,Mexico,Montserrat,Martinique,Saint Martin,Saint Lucia,Cayman Islands,Saint Kitts and Nevis,Jamaica,Haiti,Honduras,Guatemala,Guadeloupe,Dominican Republic,Dominica,Curacao,Cuba,Costa Rica,Canada,Belize,Bahamas,Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba,Bermuda,Saint Barth̩lemy,Barbados,Aruba,Anguilla,Antigua and Barbuda,French Guiana,Venezuela,Uruguay,Suriname,Paraguay,Peru,Guyana,South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,Falkland Islands,Ecuador,Colombia,Chile,Bouvet Island,Brazil,Bolivia,Argentina,Samoa,Wallis and Futuna,Vanuatu,U.S. Minor Outlying Islands,Tuvalu,Tonga,Tokelau,Solomon Islands,Palau,Pitcairn Islands,Papua New Guinea,French Polynesia,New Zealand,Niue,Nauru,Norfolk Island,New Caledonia,Northern Mariana Islands,Marshall Islands,Kiribati,Heard Island and McDonald Islands,Guam,Micronesia,Fiji,Christmas Island,Cook Islands,Cocos [Keeling] Islands,Australia,American Samoa","Cryonod: Recovering energy from natural gas networks by liquidizing industrial gases (Energy,Infrastructures);Efficient smart grid technology: Controlling the energy balance in the isolated grids (Buildings & Shelters,Energy);Biomethane for clean transportation: Production and distribution of biomethane as fuel  (Energy,Freight);VACON® NXP Grid Converter: An alternative source of marine power technology to power ships in ports (Energy,Infrastructures);",https://solarimpulse.com/companies/abb,ABB,784_C,ABB is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries,Company,1883.0,144000,innovator,Ludvig,Fredholm,,,,, Suíça,http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3a%2f%2fnew.abb.com%2f,https://twitter.com/ABBgroupnews,https://www.linkedin.com/company/abb,,"ABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries.

AWA promotes and enhances the endeavors and entrepreneurship of the African Woman and women around the world -especially in the developing countries.

Our first objective is to bring awareness to AWA (EVE) project launched in Senegal by WIN AFRICA® in 2017, which literally places energy in the hands of the African women promoting them through an innovative smart solar energy system i.e. powerful, compact, lightweight, and conceived with the spirit of the African Woman in mind

Indeed, WIN AFRICA currently places African Women and those of other developing countries at the forefront of its projects and offers solutions such as:

The Smart Solar Energy Station: for a reliable, high performance, compact, access to harmless electricity for each household in peri-urban and rural areas. 

- Smart solar station for Home, SME and Corporate energy needs.

The African Woman gains energy independence through access to electricity for her personal enterprising and entrepreneurial efforts. 

In Europe, we welcome the relatively recent peak in interest of our smart solar station within the yachting community, and the summer homeowners found in rural areas of southern Europe.

I achieved my objective in early 2018 through my invention of the AWA smart solar station which was actually the next generation of my original 2010 product the Intelligent Direct Coupling® (IDC) Inverterless Solar Station. After living and working more than 15 years among the peoples of Africa where I was able to examine the daily routines of the African Woman in approximately 13 Sub-Saharan African countries.

With their innovative conception and design these unique, unmanned surface boats are characterized by four crucial elements.



- First of all, their very high level of stability: due to their asymmetrical hulls, pitch and roll motions are considerably reduced. Such design also provides the specificity of generating very low physical and noise disturbance to the equipment installed on board.



- Range is definitely another key component of the SphyrnaALVs. The ships are propelled by an electric engine powered by solar, wind and tidal energy. This energy mix provides power for the propulsion system as well as for on-board equipment without any consumption of carbon energy. In addition, the hulls of the vessels have been optimized to reduce drag and therefore energy consumption. All these specifications allow us to carry out 10- month offshore missions, at a speed of 5 knots.



- The Sphyrna's third asset is their lightweight and strong architecture.  The Sphyrna-Odyssey mission perfectly demonstrated the ships' adaptability to the very demanding requirements of acoustic missions, as well as their robustness in the severe winter conditions of the Mediterranean Sea in which they were operated between September 2019 and March 2020. Such reliability is even more remarkable as the Sphyrna were also designed to be deployed and dismounted very easily by an extremely reduced team of two people. Transportable in standard 40-foot containers, they can be easily deployed anywhere in the world.



- The last specificity of the Sphyrna is their capacity to load more than a ton of material, which makes them precious data collectors, for up to fifty different types of data, including : passive acoustic monitoring, measurement of anthropogenic factors (noise pollution, chemical quality of the environment, radioactivity,

etc.), 3D photogrammetry of Posidonia meadows and of seabed, currents, and many other parameters useful to scientists and companies to better understand and manage human activities in a sustainable way.



The environmental, societal, economic and political issues of the 21st century will be closely linked to our oceans. And yet, this vast and complex ecosystem is still largely unknown (according according to the International Hydrographic Organization only 10% of the seabed relief is known beyond 200 metres of depth). Based on this observation, a question arises: how to transform human activities and guarantee their sustainability for our oceans if we do not have the capacity to correctly know, track and monitor 71% of our planet? It is clear that the awareness of economic and political decision makers in the field of maritime issues is now accelerating and that many of them are willing to get involved in sustainable actions. To do so, they need technological equipment tested and made reliable for oceanic use, but also resolutely innovative vectors to be able to deploy these technologies on a large scale: the Sphyrna ALVs were designed with this objective. The ambition of Sea Proven is to become the leading supplier of ocean data in Europe by deploying a constellation of several hundred Sphyrna ALVs throughout the world. Operating like sea satellites, they will make possible to draw an accurate mapping of our oceans in real time, thus enriching the data already acquired by conventional tools (satellites, drifting buoys, research vessels).

Born from the union of the start-ups xFarm and Farm Technologies, the company's aim is to drive the digital transformation of the agrifood sector.



The company's offer consists of three pillars: technological solutions for farm and supply chain management, digitalisation project management and training activities for farmers, professionals and agrifood managers. Working in these three areas, it is possible to implement a change that is expressed both on the tools front and on the upskilling front.

Today, xFarm Technologies' services are used by more than 120.000 farms, covering more than 1,6 million hectares, in more than 100 countries worldwide, 25 of which have an active presence.



The core services of xFarm are a management platform, a dashboard of supply chain analytics and advanced agronomic algorithms.

The platform is a Farm Management Information System, i.e. an application that can be used from both PCs and smartphones, and covers all areas of any farm. In fact, there are functions covering business administration, bureaucracy, financial management, agronomy, sustainability, agromechanics and precision agriculture. The aim of this product, tailor-made for modern farmers, is to combine in one simple tool all those disciplines that would normally take place in complex and separate software.

In parallel, xFarm Technologies also offers IoT devices, such as weather stations, pest monitoring traps and environmental sensors, which allow field parameters to be monitored for advanced advice through predictive modelling.



xFarm Analytics is a dashboard for the aggregation of data at the level of the entire supply chain and makes it possible to view the agronomic situation of the conferring farms, the environmental impact (CO2, Water, Acidification) and the supply chain relationships, both at the overview level and at the level of the individual farm. The use of this tool is coupled with a digital transformation path, where agronomists and engineers from xFarm Technologies support the partner on implementation, training and project management.



xFarm LAB, on the other hand, is the division of xFarm Technologies that deals with Research and Development with a strong Market-Driven connotation, creating IT and IoT solutions applied to agronomy that, integrated in xFarm or in the partners' systems, use data to provide decision support to the farmer. To date, the group has already developed strong know-how in the areas of irrigation, crop protection, yield monitoring, integration with agricultural machinery and Internet of things in agriculture.



xFarm Technologies today has a team of more than 60 people in 4 offices (Lugano, Milan, Rome, Barcelona) and pursues its goals of increasing agribusiness sustainability through a focus on user experience, technology integration and cooperation throughout the supply chain.",http://xfarm.ag,"SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

The predominant methods of surface maintenance are open grit blasting and water jet blasting.  They crush old paint into microplastics, and if these microplastics are not collected (and for the most part, with the traditional systems they are not!), those paint microplastics are released into the environment. To tackle this challenge, the Pinovo system delivers a solution that removes paint and rust from corroded steel surfaces, without microplastics emissions. Inside the tools, grit hits the surface to be treated at high speed. The old paint and rust are then sucked back into the system by vacuum, and are kept in a closed loop and not released into the environment. The grit is recycled and reused 10 to 20 times. After treatment, the surface has a superior finish, and is ready for the new coating. In this way, Pinovo's circular system stops the contamination of the oceans with the paint microplastics from traditional open grit blasting and water jet blasting methods, specifically addressing the objectives of SDG14.1.","November 2, 2020",Pinovo AS,Norway,Small scale commercialization,"New clients, Visibility, Funding, Credibility","BusinessConstruction, BusinessEnergy Utility, BusinessWater Utility, BusinessServicesBuildings Operators, BusinessServicesInfrastructureAirports and Airbases, BusinessServicesInfrastructurePorts and Marine Infrastructure, BusinessServicesInfrastructureRoads & Road Traffic Infrastructure, BusinessServicesInfrastructureTrain Stations and Railways Infrastructure, Public Authorities","Paints, Sand-blasting, Maintenance and inspection, Marine & Oceans, Walls & facades, Cleaning, Construction & demolition waste, Reduce & prevent waste","Infrastructures, Industry/Goods, Buildings, Waste/Pollution, Materials and chemicals, Manufacturing and construction processes, Solid waste management",https://youtu.be/YUgbsktkWE0,Prevents the emissions of paint micro plastics and blasting material into the environment (SDG14.1);Up to 80% reduction in grit usage compared to open blasting systems resulting in CO2 emissions reduction from both blasting grit production & transportation (SDG 12.5);Reduces the emission of paint microplastics into the environment from surface treatment to zero (SDG 12.4);,Cost savings of up to 60% for customers doing spot blasting and using rope access;Recycling of grit 10 to 20 times reduces grit usage by up to 80%;,"Europe,North america","Sweden,Norway,Netherlands,United Kingdom,France,Trinidad and Tobago","WOODOO: A bio-based translucent wood material for sustainable construction applications (Industry & Consumer Goods);SEAB Energy - Flexibuster: A small-scale modular container for transforming organic waste into energy (Energy,Waste & Pollution,Food & Agriculture);Pellenc ST: Optical sorting machines to recycle large amounts of waste quickly and accurately (Waste & Pollution);Low-cost substructure system: Bottom-fixed offshore turbine prototype that can be installed safely, simply and without cranes (Energy,Infrastructures);",https://solarimpulse.com/companies/pinovo-as,Pinovo AS,808_C,"Pinovo has developed, patented and commercialised clean sand blasting technology that stops Paint Microplastic Emissions",Company,2009.0,5,innovator,Bjorn,Ove Dalseide,,,,, Norway,https://facebook.com/pinovo,https://twitter.com/Pino_Vo,https://www.linkedin.com/company/pinovo,,"Pinovo AS is a Norwegian CleanTech company that has developed, patented and commercialised sand blasting technology, that is cleaner, safer, circular and more cost efficient than traditional surface treatment methods.

Sumfoam enables a completely new class of polymer materials by reducing the pore size within the foam by a factor 1000 compared to common foams.

Today, there is a strong desire in both politics and industry—motivated by growing climate and health concerns—to make an ecological change in the way we live.

However, despite financial and tax incentives, consumers are still reluctant to embrace greener solutions, such as electric cars or home solar power systems.

Many are worried about adopting green energy solutions due to doubts about electricity consumption and the reliability of batteries.

The use of electric vehicles, for example, raises serious concerns about battery life and the quality of used batteries.



OUR GOALS



Our aim is to speed up this crucial green revolution by offering tools especially designed to meet the needs of businesses and individual consumers, in order to reassure them and convince them to adopt a greener lifestyle.

In addition, we wish to contribute to the development of new battery technologies, thanks to our unique technical expertise in battery performance.



OUR SOLUTIONS



In house, we develop advanced technical expertise related to lithium-ion battery performance and to the changes in the way batteries are used in the real world, thanks to a Machine Learning model derived from data collected directly in the marketplace. This approach is both unique and innovative, since the results are based on how batteries are actually used, as compared to the vast majority of experiments today, in which lab conditions are greatly removed from reality and thus skew the results.

In addition, we create services and products based on this expertise, for individuals and businesses alike, in response to their specific concerns. These services allow us to obtain the necessary data to improve our Machine Learning algorithms.",http://batteriesforpeople.com,SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities,1.0

",Company,2015.0,3,innovator,Dr.,Robert Stephenson,,,,,"West Vancouver, BC V7S 3C6, Canada",,https://twitter.com/Mr.,,,"MicroPoP uses a proven mechanical device to lyse (or pop) bacteria in waste activated sludge (WAS), a waste by-product from municipal and some industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), eliminating WAS for costly dewatering and disposal.  



MicroPoP lyses microbial cells using a high pressure homogenizer, a proven industrial machine that has been used in food processing for decades.  This cell disruption converts WAS into a readily available food source to produce biogas by anaerobic digestion, and/or formation of carbon dioxide gas by aerobic co-digestion with in-coming wastewater in the WWTP' aerobic treatment system.



MicroPoP provides the following operational, environmental, and economic benefits:

•	Destruction of WAS by aerobic activated sludge treatment and/or by anaerobic digestion, so dewatering and disposal of WAS is no longer needed.

•	Significant savings in operating costs and capital costs for sludge management at WWTPs.

•	Reduced GHG emissions through less truck hauling, less sludge to degrade to methane upon disposal, lower polymer use, and biogas displacement of fossil fuels, helping cities achieve carbon neutral and climate action goals.

•	Less residual solids (only primary solids remain) for handling, processing, and disposal, and therefore less reliance on landfills, incinerators, or land application.

•	Increased biogas production by double or more by anaerobic digestion, increasing energy self sufficiency for WWTPs.

•	Reduced treatment time for anaerobic digestion, increasing the digester capacity by three times, so fewer or smaller digesters are needed.  This avoids high capital costs to build additional anaerobic digesters and to increase capacity for sludge handling, thickening, storage and transport.

•	By liquefying secondary WAS, MicroPoP reverses WWTPs' effect of concentrating pharmaceuticals, metals and PFAS in sludge.

•	Small and modular equipment can be retrofitted into the available footprint of most wastewater treatment plants.

•	Phosphorus removal with a technology called MagPi as a simple add-on. MagPi became available one year ago.

•	Ammonia nitrogen removal with a technology called Misty as a simple add-on.  Misty became available about 6 months ago.

•	MicroPoP minimizes costs to process WAS and extracts value from waste in the form of biogas for renewable energy and nutrients for sustainable agriculture.",http://eagleridgeinnovation.com,"SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy, SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 - Responsible consumption and production",1.0

There’s a clear need for more efficient motors to save energy, cut power bills and reduce CO2 emissions. The IE5 ultra-premium SynRM motors offer up to 50% lower energy losses, lower energy consumption than the commonly used IE2 induction motors. Case studies in industrial installations have demonstrated energy savings of up to 25%, depending on the application. The IE5 level of efficiency is made possible by the SynRM design which combines the performance advantages of permanent magnet technology with the simplicity and service-friendliness of an induction platform. To ensure an environmentally friendly design, the permanent magnets do not feature rare earth materials. Additional benefits of the IE5 SynRM motor are lower bearing and winding temperatures for enhanced reliability and long life. The design also creates less motor noise for a better working environment. IE5 SynRM motors can be used in a wide range of demanding industrial applications where they offer accurate control and high efficiency across the whole speed range, even at partial loads. This makes them an ideal upgrade option for standard induction motors in pumps, fans and compressors as well as in more demanding applications like extruders, concha mixers, winches, and conveyors. IE5 SynRM motors are an easy replacement for induction motors as they have the same size and output power, so no mechanical modifications are required.

Today, most of these countries suffer big energy issues such as unreliable fuel supply, fuel dependency resulting in common electricity shortages.  At the moment, the majority of the sugar mills are inefficient, meaning that their energy consumption is extremely high, while they could be a source of power generation for national grids. The Green Sugar solution is targeting the heart of the sugar industry process, the cogeneration biomass thermal installations. The direct result of the optimization is ample clean energy that can be used for production needs and sold as clean energy to national electricity grids. The sugar mills get concrete results and return on investment within a known repayment period while reducing their environmental footprint.","October 9, 2020",BMA,Canada,Prototype testing 1:1 in the lab,"Network, New clients, Visibility, Funding, Partners, Credibility","BusinessFarming & AgricultureCrops, BusinessFarming & AgricultureForestry & Logging, BusinessManufacturingFood Products, BusinessManufacturingPaper Products

Those same trucks generate a considerable amount of pollution that must be reduced: in London, for instance, road freight is responsible for 13% of CO2, 24% of NOx, and 12% of PM2.5 emissions. How can this circle be squared? Some use cases, like short, clearly defined, and unchanging back-to-base routes, such as postal delivery, lend themselves to electrification but this is not the case for the majority of 12t to 44t vehicles and OEM offerings reflect this. Even when available, fully-electric solutions require operators to spend more, haul less, and to depend on charging infrastructure which is sometimes proprietary, in a business sector where margins are razor-thin. The stop/start nature of driving urban or congested routes leads to excessive fuel consumption and emissions. By capturing energy during braking, storing it, and then using this recovered energy to help power the next acceleration, Adgero's KERS can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions on these cycles by over 20% while also reducing NOx and PM. The KERS telematics suite will stream data to the telematics solution of the operator's choice and its ECU is designed to receive over the air updates to ensure peak performance. Adgero's Kinetic Energy Recovery System is affordable, retrofittable, reusable, and compatible with virtually any HGV on the road, whether rigid or tractor-trailer combinations.

The process uses an open cycle of liquid nitrogen for liquefaction, and where nitrogen is further valorised to regenerate the polishing unit's adsorption columns.

Azola allows biomethane producers to store up to 12 000 Nm3 of biomethane under liquid form, for a later re-injection in the grid.



In fact, when congestion occurs in the natural gas distribution network during the weekends, summer, or when a producer reaches his maximum contractual injection rate, or during maintenance work, biomethane is flared in order to ramp down the pressure levels within the distribution grid, or to avoid penalties due to excess production.



With Azola, small to medium sized producers (up to 500 Nm3), are given the opportunity to temporarily store the biomethane that is today being flared, and reinject it when the distribution pipe pressure permits it.

Under the assumption that the average methanization unit operates around 8200 hours per year, this would leave a potential gap of about 565 hour per year down time, divided between periods of low demand and/or maintenance/ plant unavailability. 



For a common small-scale agricultural methanization unit in Frane (around 100 Nm3/h injection capacity) this represents a loss of about 56,500 Nm3/year of biomethane, or over 90 m3 of BioLNG. This translates to a €54,000/year loss of income, or about 5% of an average methanization plant turnover.



For such plants, the intermittent storage solution provided by Azola, could lower the GHG emissions and avoid the release into the atmosphere of about 110 tonnes of CO2-eq per year*



On the other hand, the GRID solution of AZOLA, aims to provide flexibility to the natural gas distribution network, by automatically storing gas under liquid form as soon as a preset maximum operating pressure is reached. The unit starts re-injecting the stored gas on the same part of the grid once congestion phase is gone, or elsewhere through deported injection. The GRID unit is made of transportable skids that may then be easily disconnected and displaced from one part of the network to another depending on the operational needs.



Current Projects

AZOLA Producer Unit: 

•	Project Epaux Bezu: Demonstrator plant tested from 2017 to 2019. 

The project successfully tested a liquefaction rate of up to 250 Nm3/h of biomethane, with a storage capacity of 10 Nm3 of bioGNL.

 



•	Project Plainval: Currently under final engineering phase, the plant is set to start operating on September 2020 with a liquefaction capacity of 250 Nm3/h of biomethane, and a storage capacity of 20 Nm3 of bioGNL.

AZOLA Grid Unit:

•	Project Flores: a pilot project is set to start operations on November 2020 in partnership with GrDF. The plant will be testing our first polishing module designed to treat fossil gas, and test the intermittent storage solution as a localized flexibility tool that aims to accomodate more biogmethane into the blend, and handle congestion issues at grid edge.



*Assumption is made on a 565 hours per year of down time basis, and where all the biomethane produced at a rate of 100 Nm3/h undergoes a complete combustion where 1 mol of CH4 produces 1 mol of CO2.

Floating solar is a relatively new technology. Ocean Suns has developed a novel solution to floating solar based on rigid solar modules mounted on hydro-elastic membranes. Designed for minimal use of materials, the solution is efficient at a lower cost. The lean floater design reduces wind drag and the hydro-elastic properties provide excellent seaworthiness. Extensive use of recyclable polymer materials reduces problems with corrosion and fatigue. Consequently, the Ocean Sun solution enables floating solar to a larger geographical area.

This novel patented technology is composed of  modified silicon PV solar modules deployed on a special floating membrane structure. The hydro-elastic property of the thin polymer support floating membrane prevents breaking of waves and salt water intrusion, similar to the effect of oil on troubled water.",Company,2016.0,10,innovator,Børge,Bjørneklett,,,,, Norway,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-sun,,"The Ocean Sun floating system requires minimal use of materials (and of commodity nature). It is simple and quick to assemble and install, almost to plug-and-play. It requires a very low Capex, which represents a reduction of 20% compared to other FPV already in the market for freshwater. The fact that the Ocean Sun system uses standard (off-the-shelf) components enables a business model based on high local content in the supply-chain. Unlike some competitors who establish central factories and ship equipment worldwide, Ocean Sun will procure material locally, and train local firms to do the construction and installation activities.

More than 80% of the solar radiation falling on PV cells is not converted to electricity. It is lost by reflection, transmission or absorption. Reflected radiation is about 5-10% depending on the incident angle in comparison to transmitted and absorbed radiation. About 20% the non-reflected energy is converted into electricity and the rest into heat, which inevitably increases the PV panel temperature. Higher temperature have a negative influence on PV panel efficiency, which is highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations: PV output efficiencies can be reduced by 10-25% under real-life operating conditions (i.e. temperatures of 60-70ºC). Our innovative 1mm thick floating hydro-elastic membrane provides 8-10% average higher efficiency over the day as a result of the consistent contact and cooling effect between the solar cell modules and the water body. Cells operate at a lower temperature through direct heat transfer to the water. 



Floater system architecture and seaworthiness is obtained with materials that are durable with world class maritime quality and are 100% recyclable. With superior seaworthiness albeit minimum use of material, the floater is composed by the floating membrane itself and by a mooring system, both designed for optimal offshore usage with a technology inspired by the aquaculture industry, which has been in use for over 20 years in Norwegian rough waters. The unique UV and hydrolysis-resistant floating membrane have been designed to (1) effectively prevent breaking of waves, (2) move with regular sea swell, and (3) provide an absolute barrier between solar panels and saltwater. 

The floating membrane is specifically built to ensure good and safe working environment for installers who almost ""walk on water"" , so the modules can be securely and efficiently attached to withstand rough weather. PV modules are not harmed even when exposed to quite harsh sea conditions. The Ocean Sun Design Premise has received a “Statement of Conformance” from DNV GL. Five demonstration systems has been built on the west coast of Norway, in the Johur strait in Singapore and on Luzon Island in the Philippines.

","Air quality has become an issue worldwide, most importantly because of the harm it causes to people, but also because of regulations which demand companies worldwide to abide to air quality emission standards. The goal for this solution is to help companies operating in harsh terrains to be able to monitor the air quality in the area of operations, thus being able abide to these laws. The solution: the Andean Drone, a drone aimed towards mining companies operating in harsh conditions, named after the Andes mountains in Peru. This drone is capable of flying in altitudes up to 5000 meters above sea level, wind velocities of up to 30 km/h, resistant to rain and extreme climates. This drone is adequate for working in the harsh conditions where mining operations usually take place. It carries a load which monitors the concentration of particulate matter and pollutant gasses.

Air is the most valuable resource of our planet and nowadays is being threatened by the high levels of pollution: bad air quality causes 1 in 10 deaths worldwide, 7 million people die each year. It also contributes to climate change. The current solution for air quality monitoring consists of dispersed networks of static stations that capture isolated information in small areas and limited heights; these cost approximately $ 300,000.00 in implementation. This is a costly and non-scalable solution.



qAIRa, Guardian of the Air, has the main objective of monitoring air quality continuously anytime and anywhere. qAIRa proposes to complement the dispersed networks of air quality monitoring, with dynamic, scalable and high density networks conformed by drones and modules that measure in real time the environmental contamination (gases, dust, climate). Our low-cost technological tools are efficient for environmental monitoring in wide areas. The information is processed using big data analytics and is democratized through a map of global pollution in a mobile application, with the purpose of empowering the people to know the air they breathe and even ask their authorities for actions in favor of the environment.



In 2013, around 9,500 million metric tons of carbon were emitted globally, of which 21% were from industrial activities; Peru contributed with 0.2% of these greenhouse gas emissions. The economic and political situation is favorable for businesses related to the care and protection of the environment. The governments are more demanding in the compliance of environmental laws (in Peru the law establishes the Environmental Quality Standards and Maximum Allowable Levels) and are more aware in their controls, this drives companies into being responsible in the use of their resources and increase their environmental controls. Besides of this, people are everyday more concerned about their health and the protection of the environment.



qAIRa develops in-house technology in hardware and software, which are robust for difficult geographical conditions (operations at 5000 masl), autonomous and connected through mobile 4G internet. The products qAIRa offers are the following:



	qAIR: unmanned aerial system for air quality monitoring.

	qHAWAX: fixed module for continuous air quality monitoring.

	qDUST: unmanned aerial system for dust detection.

	qEYE: unmanned aerial system for industrial and environmental safety.

	qLAND: unmanned aerial system for topographical mapping.

	qFARM: unmanned aerial system for precision agriculture.

	qMAP: specialized software that shows in mobile application the real-time air quality information of qAIRa’s products and other equipment that measure environmental pollution.



The members of qAIRa are recognized professionals in the innovation and entrepreneurship fields, with experience in robotics and environmental projects. qAIRa has key alliances with national and international institutions. At the national level, with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP), the National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy of Peru (SNMPE), the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI).

THE CONTRAIL CLIMATE CHALLENGE:

Recent research shows that contrails formed by aircraft at cruise generate 59% of aviation’s climate impact, versus 32% arising from direct CO2 engine emissions. Future NetZero emission engines and fuels may exacerbate contrail formation as a result of higher water emissions. Contrail formation therefore presents the most significant climate challenge that aviation will face in the post-COVID19 era. SATAVIA is currently the only team offering a practicable solution to the contrail challenge.











OUR SOLUTION:

SATAVIA’s unique DECISIONX:NETZERO system uses AI-powered data analytics and enterprise-grade data to deliver actionable insight, enabling aircraft operators to accurately forecast, avoid, validate, quantify and offset aviation contrail emissions.



Pre-flight, operators can optimise flight plans to minimise contrail formation by targeting low-risk altitudes identified by SATAVIA modelling. Post-flight, DECISIONX:NETZERO validates contrail formation against modelled predictions and quantifies climate benefit, which is then converted into carbon offset credits for operators. With a conservative target of 50% contrail prevention, SATAVIA could enable annual emissions savings in excess of >1,000 Mt CO2e/year across all operators.



Alongside ongoing, incremental efforts to develop greener engines and fuels, DECISIONX:NETZERO offers a revolutionary, application-ready solution capable of targeting and minimising aviation’s most damaging environmental impact.



While SATAVIA’s vision centres on the goal of making aviation greener, the company also offers products focused on improving condition monitoring. SATAVIA’s DECISIONX:FLEET allows operators to improve asset condition monitoring (e.g. corrosion risks for parked aircraft) by ~10%, while also optimising engine core

SOFTCAR offers a new solution of soft mobility, ideal for cleaning up urban centers. Everything is designed at SOFTCAR to reduce the carbon footprint as much as possible. The vehicles are designed in 4 modules, which are sent from assembly centers.



DNA: Descendant in direct line of Swatch - mobile idea, SOFTCAR took over from 0 the conception of a vehicle to propose a new solution allowing to produce vehicles with the lowest carbon footprint ever realized.

From the off-site assembly center, to the new materials used, to the ultra-light chassis, everything at Softcar is designed taking into account the complete life cycle of the vehicle to reduce the carbon footprint.

The genes of evolution have been integrated at the start and 4 bodies and 16 graphics will be produced annually.

Via the ""Soft Cloud database"", users will send back a global user experience and the evolution will be in the addition of lightness, reduction of CO2, and reduction of the carbon footprint, safety and associated services.

The chassis and hull have been designed to enter the circular economy and the license sale system allows us to quickly propagate our Softcar product all over the planet, which will ultimately allow these avant garde vehicles to be distributed for the most large number.

We are positioning ourselves as precursors of a paradigm shift in the design, manufacture and distribution of our vehicles.

We let you discover in this document how, starting from the probably cleanest car, we are going to make leaser our vehicles cheaper than our competitors and how we manage to concentrate such a quantity of USP on a single vehicle.

Mission: The Mission of SOFTCAR is to offer a solution to depollute mobility in the megacities of our planet. SOFTCAR has designed the cleanest car and the assembly center to produce, sell, recycle vehicles as close as possible to users. We introduced a notion of sharing in the limited series then that part of the gain from the sales is returned to humanitarian organizations

Goal: The company goal is to reduce CO2  for mobility.

To achieve this goal, SOFTCAR  WILL finalize the development of a clean city car, will  set-up a pilot plant in Switzerland in order to demonstrate that SOFTCAR is the lowest cost and cleanest car ever, and then leverage on this success , with a geographically distributed manufacturing model based on a worldwide licensing approach. License package contain patents right of use, factory and equipment  layout, parts design,  access to production tools , complete recipice to build the cleanest car ,communication  from SWIZERLAND, parts organization to start an assembly production plant in a few months, new limited series of graphic art .



Technologies: SOFTCAR SA has developed a range of innovative technologies to conceive vehicles with very low environmental footprint. These technologies are mainly based on the massive use of novel materials such as polymers and advanced composites, which allows for vehicles with breakthrough light weight architectures to be produced. This approach also reduces by a factor 20 the number of parts in the vehicle compared to standard commercial electric vehicles, which simplifies enormously the manufacturing process and hence the production costs. A further key innovation lies in the complete decoupling of the chassis and body, away from classical integrated steel frame chassis, which offers a range of technical and commercial advantages, as a complete SOFTCAR  body can be  



Micro-manufacturing: SOFTCAR’s manufacturing process is unprecedentedly low capex, thanks to the very simple vehicle architecture and assembling approach. This unique manufacturing approach allows for micro-factories with capacity as low as 5000 vehicles / year to be economically viable, while producing clean vehicles with highly competitive prices. This is a paradigm shift compared to the current trend for automotive giga-factories. Moreover, each micro-factory could benefit from a dedicated vehicle design. These assets offer the unique opportunity to deploy geographically distributed micro-factories to meet local market needs, while generating local jobs and strong product identification by local populations.  



Licensing model: The company goal is to set-up a pilot plant in Switzerland to produce and commercialize a SOFTCAR city car in order to demonstrate that our technologies allow to manufacture the lowest cost and cleanest car ever. We will then leverage on this success to capture growing market shares globally, both for city cars and light duty vehicles, based on a worldwide licensing approach for micro-factories. License packages contain amongst other things the right of use of SOFTCAR’s patents, the factory and equipment layout, the parts design, the complete manufacturing recipe, the technology transfer until operational start-up, and a unique vehicle design upon request.

Today, heating and cooling small businesses and residential settings represent 25% of the EU’s energy consumption. Condensing boilers and heat pumps are the main options nowadays. If heat pumps have a much better energy efficiency than condensing boilers, they are also more expensive during the initial installation and their exploitation. Indeed, heat pumps are powered with electricity coming from the grid and their efficiency is jeopardized by the higher cost of the electricity in comparison to natural gas. In addition, during wintertime, the efficiency of the heat pump significantly decreases which contributes to a significant increase of electricity consumption. Moreover, the inefficiencies of centralized production (40%) and the losses in transportation (5-10%) contribute to lower the global footprint of heat pumps.

Fuel is a major cost factor, accounting for about 30% of operating costs. The importance of reducing fuel increases with rising fuel prices, climate change and the need for shippers to reduce the environmental impact of supply chains. Yet, fuel management today often only happens at the end of the month for reporting purposes. Measures to increase fuel efficiency are missed out as they are dispersed across different fleet activities. Tracks provides road freight carriers a fuel and emissions management tool to centrally measure, reduce and report the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of their truck fleet. With Tracks' solution, fuel efficiency measures are identified through AI-based digital twins of every truck.

As they wear out, brake pads and tires, as well as the road surface itself, release particles of dust in the ambient air. Several studies in Science of The Total Environment or in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology have shown that automotive brake wear particles are a major source of Fine Particulate Matter (PM10) originating from motor vehicles. Specifically, brake wear dust is estimated to contribute 16-55% of non-exhaust traffic-related emissions. The impact of this pollution is catastrophic as it can cause cardio-respiratory problems or lung cancer to those who are exposed. According to EEA (European Environment Agency), air pollution kills over 500,000 Europeans a year. Based on innovative technology, it is possible to eliminate polluting conventional braking systems.

Seawind assembles those systems not at sea as it is done today with the use of expensive crane vessels or jackups. The Seawind systems are assembled at a pier or at a dry dock and brought to the installation site completely assembled. In the case of floating systems, installation means simply anchoring. In the case of bottom fixed systems, installation means lowering the complete system to the seabed and actuate suction buckets. The time of installation is drastically reduced, complete systems can be stored in sheltered waters for installation during calm weather windows. The overall time for the realization of a complete offshore wind farm (500+ MW) goes down to less than one year. Foundations are made of UHPC, the lifetime of the wind farm is 50+ years, hence the system can run for many years at marginal costs, like large hydropower plants.

The future energy mix will have to drastically shift towards utility-scale offshore wind power generation. The current offshore wind industry, especially floating, still faces significant technical and economic challenges. We have the answer to these challenges: the Seawind floating wind turbines.



The potential of the offshore market is huge, 80% of which is floating, with over 1500 GW projected to be installed by 2050. Seawind’s technology has a solid pedigree starting with R&D delivered by NASA and United Technology Company. Our operational 1.5 MW wind turbine prototype in Italy proved the effectiveness of our technology. It has been improved over the years to achieve Technology Qualification in December 2019 with DNV for our 6.2 and 12.2 MW turbines. We have also developed our own floating structure which raises the benefits of our integrated floating wind turbine system even further.



Seawind’s DNA is to develop affordable green energy solutions. At the heart of our wind turbine technology, there is a flexible joint between the rotor and the shaft, which makes the system simpler, flexible, and more robust compared to the state-of-the-art 3-bladed technology. With our 25-35% energy cost advantage compared to our competitors, Seawind is the ideal solution for floating configurations and will contribute to unlocking the green hydrogen value chain. 



Today, investors have the unique opportunity to invest in Seawind and make a difference for our planet. The funds will be used to demonstrate our scaled-up technology by building and operating our demonstrator Seawind 6 and pre-series Seawind 12. The commercial deployment will start in 2024-2025.

That goal, which we have already achieved technically, was to not only reduce a Bitcoin Farms and Data Centers energy consumption but to do so while maintaining a lower overall cost in comparison with all other alternatives including the incumbent, air-cooling.



In brief summary, we provide miners and servers with the power of liquid cooling without the risk. It increases cooling efficiency massively while reducing energy use and risk. Yet this is achieved without ever exposing electronic systems to the risk of a liquid coolant.



Our mission has since shifted as we realized that with access to a large source of unused waste-heat we could easily bring it at the level of quality and quantity to capture CO2 from the atmosphere directly. This also applies to all bitcoin farms and data centers' waste heat regardless of their cooling technologies.



Put simply,blockchains, web and other online services currently contribute negatively to climate change. With our solution, those same blockchains and online services will instead remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere!

The results were impressive and Absolicon was founded to commercialize the results.

Today, the goals have been achieved. The Absolicon T160 solar collector has the highest ever measured optical efficiency for a small parabolic trough giving outstanding heat production for many applications. The T160 is also the only concentrating solar collector with the Solar Keymark quality mark in the world.

Absolicon Solar Collector AB is a Swedish limited company, listed on the Spotlight Stock Exchange with more than 3000 owners where the largest is the Byström family, owning ca 30% of the shares.

The board of directors has senior management experience in sales, engineering, finance and research. It consists of three members representing the mayor shareholders and two independent members. The management consist of the four head of departments and the CEO, all with academic degree in their respective profession.

Total staff count is 30 including five more or less permanent consultants. Subcontractors to produce solar collector material and production line components are located both in Sweden and around the world. 

To protect the immaterial rights of the solar thermal system, Absolicon has an internal patent attorney managing the 9 patent families pending. The patents are ranging from collector design to production line systems.

Absolicon has world-class research in solar thermal materials and a research budget of above €1M. Research partners include SPF in Switzerland, DTU in Denmark and Umeå Universitet in Sweden. Several large research projects are continuous ongoing.

Absolicon offer solar collectors and integration of solar heat and steam in industry and district heating networks on the Swedish market. 

Globally, the product Absolicon is offering is the robotized production line for the T160. Already one production line has been built in Sweden, one is sold to the Sichuan province and one was recently ordered from South Africa. Each production line has the capacity to produce 50 MW (100 000 m2) of solar concentrators annually and is operated on a licence basis.

Absolicon also supply key material and components, service and project planning services to the production line buyers.

For industrial heat, the main markets beside South Africa and China are countries with high solar radiation and high energy costs like India, Mexico, Chile, Jordan. There is also a market for soar district heating in countries like Denmark, Germany and France. Clients for the production lines are envisioned to be manufacturing industries interested in starting production and getting into the market of solar thermal.

From Sweden, Absolicon sales staff reach out to industrial companies and potential buyers of production lines. Currently there are agreements signed with interested parties in 12 countries. Competition is weak in the market for small parabolic troughs with a 5-10 companies around the world. The main competition is from “business-as-usually” and a continued burning of oil, gas and coal.

In Sweden there is a fully operational production line with two six-axis ABB-robots for domestic production and as demonstration plant for buyers. It is residing in the 3500 m2 workshop that Absolicon is renting and that also house a solar lab for quasi-dynamic collector testing, a full CNC workshop, logistic area and offices.

Absolicon has a long history of sales of solar thermal systems in many different applications. The technology concept is proven with installations in several countries, several peer-previewed scientific papers and performance assessments from certified solar thermal testing institutes.

In 2019/2020 Absolicon is launch a marketing and sales campaign “Replace burning of oil, gas and coal with solar thermal energy” towards energy and environmental middle-management in multinational companies. As several of these companies have ambitious climate targets, solar thermal will be very attractive to the management, solving CO2 emissions and increasing energy security and profitability simultaneously.

Building this interest from the multinational companies on selected markets will ensure that Absolicon also find buyers of the production lines, can establish regional production of the best solar collector in the world and quickly change the energy situation in that region – from fossil fuel to solar energy!

The vast majorities are engaged in dairy or agriculture, their primary income generating activities. These farming activities have significant under-utilized agri or farm waste output. This waste can be processed into Renewable Natural Gas (RNG, enriched from Biogas), a high-quality clean fuel that can be used for cooking, transportation and agricultural machinery to improve the energy access. In rural areas, if high quality fuel like RNG is made available, it can provide access to clean energy for diverse applications to catalyze economic development.

 

Grassroots Energy’s inclusive and integrated approach involves working directly with the communities to procure waste and generate value at the local level. Each installation can positively impact 750 families. At scale of 5000 installations, our solution can touch 3.75million families. The innovative small-scale system allows for distributed model, wide-scale adoption of RNG, only commercial clean fuel solution, economical over fossil fuels, is developed using low-cost biogas enrichment and compression technology. Requisite amounts of waste in rural areas across farm or agri feedstocks are widely available. 



A distributed energy model addresses all three issues providing value, economic opportunity and ancillary benefits in terms of organic fertilizer and remediated waste. The model creates greater economic value for farmers from waste, removes carbon emissions from decomposing waste, generates organic fertilizer and provides incentives for local farmers to participate that increase their incomes and farm productivity:

 

Waste to Energy (Biogas):

The approach processes farm and agri waste into low cost fuel, biogas. Untreated waste releases methane into the atmosphere, as GHG 25X harmful over CO2. Furthermore, waste attracts pathogens that spreads disease in the vicinity. The approach to convert to Biogas, solves a range of issues for local communities.



Economical and nutrient rich organic fertilizer:

The farmers use chemical fertilizer which erodes the top soil and yields of the farms. The short-term and quick-fix approach forces the farmers to depend on the fertilizers from the retailer. Grassroots Energy aims to process the residue from Biogas digesters into high quality compost available in solid and liquid forms.

The driver for tidal stream power generation is combatting climate change by reducing the CO2 emissions with a 100% renewable, 100% reliable and 100% predictable energy source. Because of the geographical limitations and specific local characteristics for successful tidal power (micro)plants the highest value can be generated on specific locations for specific type of customers. Tidal stream power is the missing renewable energy source to create a local balanced power generation mix. 



In 1999, technology development started with a floating venturi system, after several technology changes the company moved towards the centre-based generator concept, with two blades. This is a concept showing a lot of similarities with the technology used in the wind turbine industry. With the on‐going experience the company gathered from the first full scale turbines, we completely parameterised the design of the turbines and developed the current free flow turbine technology portfolio. Nowadays the company owns 21 patents worldwide.



While tidal energy is well proven, the sector has been slow to industrialise due to high costs of manufacturing, installation, O&M, reliability and scalability that have hindered the commercialisation of the sector as a whole. Most of the companies within the sector develop their own complete solutions; turbines and (floating) foundation structures, leading to a lack of focus and hold of success.



Tocardo wants to become the first independent specialist tidal turbine developer with a focus on pure turbine development and not diverted by, or reliant upon platform development to claim our position in the market.

This is an innovative technology of based on magnetic micro-sponges (aggregates of nanoparticles) for the removal of fuels, oils, organic compounds, metals and anionic pollutants in water and gas stream air. The introduction of MagnetoSponges for the management of wastewater and processing water of industry will promote an easy way treatment to nullify the environmental impact of processes water, both favoring the reuse of it to achieve a real closed cycle in a plant but also to produce second water for applications in other fields. Due to the magnetic properties of the fluids, a new purification process based on the use of electromagnetic filter will be introduced. Moreover, the possibility to regenerate the micro-sponges recovering the substances captured suggests a treatment with low economic impact both for the possibility to re-use the micro-sponges and to obtain secondary raw materials. 

The technology lies in magnetic nanoparticles with an amphiphilic nature; therefore able to be dispersed in aqueous solutions while preserving an affinity with lipophilic phases. The nanoparticles are dispersed in water and through lipophilic interactions, they aggregate leading to micro-sponges with an extremely high surface area, formed by individual nanoparticles with diameters between 10 and 50 nm. This joint gives to the technology both the advantages in terms of extremely high surface area of nanomaterial (high efficiency) and in terms of easy removal of micro-material. The capability to control and modify the functional groups of the outer coating makes the micro-sponges customizable to different industries (Oil & Gas, Food Production, and Metallurgy for example)
